This is of concern to women's rights campaigners, who question whether educational parity can be squared with religions that traditionally subjugate women.
Clara Connolly from Women Against Fundamentalisms, which calls for the phasing out of subsidies to existing religious schools and the withdrawal of the right to establish such schools, says: 'The main problem with faith schools is that their primary purpose is to socialise women into their major roles of wives and mothers.
Her concerns were underlined by a Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, Faith as Social Capital , published in March 2006, which warned that power inequalities within religious communities could have negative effects, particularly the subordination of women. '
Women usually do most work in the community, yet the further one moves from grassroots activity towards higher levels of decision-making, the less visible they become.'
Meanwhile, concerns were expressed about the human rights of 16 to 18 year olds in religious schools.
In The Guardian Francis Beckett revealed some disturbing goings on at St Luke's Roman Catholic Sixth Form College in Sidcup, Kent.
A week before A Level exams began in the summer of 2006, 17 students were suspended for a day because they chose to miss the weekly school mass and instead spent the time revising.
On another occasion, students were compelled to walk round the playing field carrying a statue of the Virgin Mary and singing hymns.
But the most serious incident involved students being forced to listen to American evangelist Barbara McGuigan, who founded the Catholic charity Voice of Virtue International.
She told us that if we had an abortion we'd go to hell for ever.
Shortly after these events, the principal of St Luke's, Maria Williams, and the chair of governors, Father Timothy Finigan, both resigned.
But even as these events were unfolding at St Luke's, the Catholic Education Service was fighting a government proposal to allow students over 16 to opt out of compulsory worship and religious teaching, and was campaigning for the legal right to force even 18 year olds to attend mass and to be instructed in Catholic dogma.
NSS director Keith Porteous Wood commented 'The inability in law of older pupils to withdraw themselves from collective worship contravenes their rights under the Human Rights Act.
The European Convention on Human Rights gives to pupils themselves the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
The Catholic Education Service appears to think that religious schools should be exempt from the duty to apply human rights in its schools.
But these are publicly funded institutions, and human rights are universal' (Beckett 2006).
Faced with the continuing tide of hostility to religious schools, the new education secretary Alan Johnson announced that faith schools would be encouraged to launch exchange programmes with teachers of other religions, that independent faith schools should demonstrate their charitable status by cooperating more closely with non-faith schools, and that the government would require new faith schools to admit up to a quarter of their pupils from families of other faiths or none. '
We must be careful that, rather than driving people into defending their faith, we instead encourage an open celebration of our diversity,' he said. '
Schools should cross ethnic and religious boundaries, and certainly not increase them, or exacerbate the difficulties in this sensitive area' ( The Guardian 18 October 2006).
Johnson attempted to spin his way out of defeat.
I have listened carefully to colleagues on this issue', he said, 'and recognise we all share the same goal for a more cohesive society where faith schools play an important part in building understanding and tolerance of other faiths and communities' ( The Guardian 27 October 2006).
There were two more controversies in the autumn of 2006.
Adonis proposed that faith schools should be allowed to favour members of their own religion when appointing support staff.
The GMB union and the NSS said the change would extend discrimination ( The Guardian 24 October 2006).
And there was a national furore over the case of a Muslim teaching assistant who refused to remove her veil in school if a man was present.
She was eventually sacked after failing to make concessions ( The Guardian 25 November 2006).
Two Guardian/ICM surveys in December 2006 illustrated the depth of professional and public concern about religious involvement in education.
A Headspace survey of head teachers revealed that many were deeply concerned about the effects of faith schools on the education system.
Of the 801 who replied to the questionnaire (28 per cent of whom worked in faith schools), 47 per cent felt there should be either fewer or no faith schools and only 9 per cent agreed with the government that there should be more of them.
Almost half the heads said religious schools actively contributed to a less tolerant society (Crace 2006).
An overwhelming majority of the public agreed with the heads.
ICM found that 82 per cent saw religion as a cause of division and tension, with only 16 per cent disagreeing.
The poll also revealed that non-believers outnumbered believers in Britain by almost two to one ( The Guardian 23 December 2006).
The widely-held view that non-faith schools were more effective in promoting religious and racial integration was supported by research published in August 2006 by Irene Bruegel, professor of urban policy at London South Bank University (Crace 2006).
Church schools, for example, applied for exemption from new legislation to prevent schools from teaching children that homosexual acts are sinful (Crace 2006), and the Catholic church refused to follow government guidelines urging schools to set up specific policies against homophobic bullying ( The Guardian 27 March 2007).
Blind faith
Why has Tony Blair ( pictured ) been so committed to faith-based education?
He is, of course, religious himself.
But that hardly seems an adequate explanation for what has, at times, seemed like an obsession.
Looking back through his own comments, three motives are apparent.
First, he believes faith schools provide, as he himself put it, a 'high quality of education'.
Second, he sees them as a means of promoting tolerance and understanding between faith groups.
And third, he believes they have a special 'ethos' which facilitates the development of morality.
It is certainly true that church schools do generally achieve better exam results than neighbouring non-church schools.
However, as Ian and Sandie Schagen have pointed out, an analysis of the statistical evidence shows not only that the difference is extremely small but that, where faith schools do achieve marginally better results, it is usually because of the 'nature and quality of their intake' (Schagen and Schagen 2005:210).
In other words, for all Blair's bluster to the contrary, faith schools are operating a covert system of selection.
The IRIS research, showing that church schools take a significantly lower proportion of free school meal children than other schools, is just part of a mass of evidence which confirms this.
So if a 'high quality of education' is the basis of Blair's faith schools obsession, it's a pretty dubious one.
The second notion - that faith schools can promote tolerance and understanding between racial and religious groups - is equally dubious.
In fact they do exactly the opposite, as has been blatantly obvious in Bradford, Oldham, Greater Manchester and Burnley, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Researchers at Bristol and London South Bank universities and at the Young Foundation have all shown that faith schools are turning inner-city areas into monocultural zones; the Roman Catholics and the Jewish Board of Deputies have refused to accept quotas for admitting members of other faiths; and senior clerics Murphy-O'Connor and Butler don't want to see the children of Christian parents attending Muslim schools.
So much for inter-faith harmony.
The third notion - that faith schools have a special 'ethos' which facilitates the development of morality - is also highly questionable.
Look at the position of the faith groups on, for example, human rights.
Is Blair remotely concerned about the stance of faith schools on the role and rights of women, or the effect faith-based education may be having on gender relations?
Is he aware that since April 2007 there has been a legal requirement for all state schools to promote gender equality?
Do all faith schools comply with this?
It seems highly unlikely, given the Rowntree Foundation's warning about power inequalities within religious communities.
And what about the appalling events at St Luke's Roman Catholic Sixth Form College in Sidcup?
Or their determination to maintain discriminatory employment practices?
As polls have shown, only 11 per cent of people are in favour of faith schools, 82 per cent see religion as a cause of division and tension, and two thirds of the public agree that 'the government should not be funding faith schools of any kind'.
So why is taxpayers' money being used to fund private beliefs?
Is Blair completely uninterested in the views of the public?
Does 'parental choice' count for anything now?
If so, why are religiously sponsored academies being imposed on communities that don't want them?
He made a number of concessions on admissions and the role of local authorities, but refused to go further.
Writing in The Guardian Polly Toynbee acknowledged that religious schools were popular:
There may be few bums on seats in pews, but there are queues for the schools whose special 'ethos' is called closet selection.
God doesn't move in such very mysterious ways: research by the Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS) is only the latest to find that C of E and Catholic schools take a lower proportion of free-school-meal children than the average for their catchment area.
It means nearby schools have to take more, magnifying the imbalance as an unfair proportion of troubled children congregate in bog-standard schools without the magic 'ethos'.
It found that in church primary schools only 13.96 per cent of pupils were on free school meals, compared with 18.96 per cent in their catchment areas.
20.36 per cent of pupils were on free school meals, compared with 18.76 per cent in their catchment areas. '
The figures seem to indicate a strong correlation between Christianity and wealth,' said Chris Waterman, the author of the report, 'and yet that is not borne out by the population.
Emmanuel Church of England school in Camden had 17 per cent of children on free school meals, but the neighbouring Beckford community school had 44 per cent.
All the most conservative faiths - Islamic, Catholic, Jewish, evangelical - agree that women have a place in the family and that women should be educated towards that aim'.
Many faith communities fail to listen to women or young people within their number', it said. '
As a result of negotiations between Minister of Education RA Butler and Archbishop William Temple, the 1944 Education Act 'created a unified framework which brought the church schools under state control but left them with varying degrees of independence according to how much financial support the church continued to provide' (Mackinnon and Statham 1999:110).
Schools owned by the churches became 'voluntary' schools, either 'aided' (in which the church had greater control) or 'controlled' (where the local education authority had greater control).
Almost all the voluntary schools were owned by the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.
By 1997, when Tony Blair's 'New Labour' party swept to power, a quarter of England's primary schools (6,384 schools with 790,000 places) and one in twenty secondaries (589 schools with 150,000 places) were run by faith groups, all but a handful Church of England or Roman Catholic.
During his ten years in office, Blair was to demonstrate an extraordinary commitment to faith-based education, no doubt prompted, at least in part, by his own religious convictions.
Never Mind the Evidence: Blair's obsession with faith schools Derek Gillard May 2007
The Education Acts of 1902 (Balfour) and 1944 (Butler) redefined the relationship between church and state: 'a measure of independence was exchanged for the comparative security of financial support from the public service' (Brooksbank and Ackstine 1984:21).
During debates on the 1902 bill, for example, 'inside and outside Parliament there was outcry against "Rome on the rates"' (Gates 2005:19).
Anglican bishops threatened to contest the 1998 School Standards and Framework Bill because they feared it would dilute Church of England representation on the governing bodies of aided schools and change the religious character of the schools by amending admission procedures.
They were also concerned that controlled schools opting for foundation status would lose their religious character.
The dispute was resolved when the new Secretary of State for Education, David Blunkett ( pictured ), assured them that he did not want to upset the compromises of the 1944 Education Act and that church schools would continue to enjoy a considerable degree of autonomy within the state system.
In January 1998 Islamia Primary School in Brent (London) and Al Furqan Primary School in Sparkhill (Birmingham) became the first state-funded Muslim schools in England, and later that year John Loughborough Secondary School in Haringey (London) became a state-funded school run by the Seventh Day Adventists.
Having thus demonstrated its commitment to a range of faith groups, the government then announced that it wanted to see a hundred new Church of England secondary schools opened within the next five years.
In March 2000 Blunkett announced that the government intended to create a network of 'city academies' - effectively private schools paid for by the state - closely modelled on the charter schools in the US and the Conservatives' city technology colleges.
In the run-up to the 2001 general election, Tony Blair told a conference of faith groups organised by the Christian Socialist Movement that church schools were a pillar of the education system, 'valued by very many parents for their faith character, their moral emphasis and the high quality of education they generally provide' ( The Guardian 30 March 2001).
In September, angry Protestants were seen shouting abuse and hurling stones at five year old girls making their way to Holy Cross Roman Catholic School in the Ardoyne, and Islamist fundamentalists destroyed the World Trade Centre in New York.
Forty projects were already being planned, including a �12m Islamic secondary school for girls in Birmingham, an evangelical Christian school in Leeds and a new Jewish school in London.
Even the new education secretary, Estelle Morris, was said to be less than happy about them and may well have privately agreed with Professor Richard Dawkins, who, in an open letter to her, said 'After everything we've been through this year, to persist with financing segregated religion in sectarian schools is obstinate madness' ( The Observer 30 December 2001).
At the ATL conference in March 2002 delegates voted decisively to 'press the government to abandon the proposed increase in faith schools' ( The Guardian 27 March 2002).
And at the NUT conference, delegates criticised the decision to turn Ducie High School, a multicultural school in Manchester's Moss Side, into an academy run by the Church Schools Company ( The Guardian 1 April 2002).
(All of which was fairly academic in relation to Emmanuel College, since city technology colleges were not required to teach the National Curriculum.)
Questioned in the Commons by Liberal Democrat MP Dr Jenny Tonge about the use of taxpayers' money to fund the teaching of creationism, he avoided answering the question and said 'In the end, it is a more diverse school system that will deliver better results for our children and if you look at the actual results of the school, I think you will find they are very good.'
Robin McKie noted that while Scotland was attempting to tackle the problems caused by its religiously-segregated schools, England was plunging towards a 'sad, sectarian future'.
Researchers at Bristol University, led by Professor Simon Burgess, warned that the lessons of Sir Herman Ouseley's report on the Bradford riots of 2001 had been ignored and that 'white flight' and the rise of Muslim schools were turning England's inner-city playgrounds into monocultural zones which were potential breeding grounds for intolerance and racism ( The Guardian 1 April 2004).
'Faith should not be blind.
I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society.
... The growth in faith schools needs to be carefully but sensitively monitored by government to ensure that pupils at all schools receive an understanding of not only their own faith but of other faiths and the wider tenets of British society.
We must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation ... I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships.'
His comments were condemned as 'irresponsible' and 'derogatory' by senior Muslims but supported by Commission for Racial Equality chair Trevor Phillips.
Giving the Learning and Skills Development Agency's annual new year lecture in London, he said 'We can choose ... whether we want to bring our diversity together in a single rainbow or whether we allow our differences to fester into separate cultures and separate communities' ( The Guardian 19 January 2005).
Some members of the government were clearly becoming concerned about the faith schools policy, though with Blair still staunchly committed to it, there was, of course, no suggestion that the policy was about to change.
Schools minister Stephen Twigg urged faith schools to 'promote understanding' between different religions. '
All schools need to work together to meet the needs of every pupil.
Faith schools can and should be part of this collaboration,' he said.
He called on Muslim schools to promote 'tolerance and harmony' and he warned that 'religious segregation in schools must not put our coherence at risk' ( The Guardian 18 February 2005).
But none of the concerns prevented Blair from going into the general election in May 2005 with a manifesto promising even greater control of state education for religious groups and businesses.
Blair's third term: taken to extremes
In the event, New Labour won a historic third term in office, though with a much reduced majority in the Commons.
For the first time ever in a British election, the winning party gained fewer votes than the number of people who didn't vote at all.
Blair berated the public for its apathy.
But it wasn't apathy that kept people away from the polling booths.
It was a combination of disgust at Blair's decision to support Bush's Iraq war and the blatant lies which had preceded it; lack of enthusiasm for a Tory opposition which had run a distasteful campaign focused on immigration; and the fact that, in terms of policies, there was nothing to choose between Blair and the Conservatives.
There was a public outcry when Blair proposed making Andrew Adonis ( pictured ), the architect of the controversial academies programme, a minister.
He had no ministerial experience, had never been elected, and was widely seen as one of 'Tony's cronies'.
Blair ignored the concerns and gave Adonis a life peerage and the post of junior education minister.
The government's proposals for even more religious involvement in education prompted another wave of criticism.
Writing in The Observer Nick Cohen commented:
He doesn't understand its power to divide and incite and assumes that all true practitioners are like the Anglo-Catholic priests of middle-class London: upright men who do good works and wish no one ill.
David Trimble [former leader of Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist party] told John Humphrys recently that the greatest blunder after partition was to allow Catholic and Protestant schools to survive.
He might have added that the mainland is repeating Ulster's murderous mistake.
(Cohen 2005)
As the government prepared to publish proposals to make it easier for independent schools, including Islamic, Christian and Jewish institutions, to opt into the state sector and get millions of pounds in funding, a Guardian/ICM poll published in August 2005 revealed that two thirds of those questioned agreed with the statement that 'the government should not be funding faith schools of any kind' ( The Guardian 23 August 2005).
In fact, the DfES had already given the Association of Muslim Schools �100,000 to facilitate the transition of more of the 120 independent Islamic schools into the state sector.
Commons education select committee chair Barry Sheerman warned that religious schools posed a threat to the cohesion of multicultural communities. '
Schools play a crucial role in integrating different communities and the growth of faith schools poses a real threat to this.
Sheerman's view that faith schools damage community coherence was underlined the following month when David Aaronovitch interviewed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor and Anglican Bishop of Southwark Tom Butler for his BBC2 programme God and the Politicians (28 September 2005).
'Well, that would be another matter, wouldn't it?
... I wouldn't, because fundamentally, the creed of Islam is totally diverse from the creed of Christianity and while there should be dialogue between them I wouldn't want Catholic children to be, as it were, brought up in that particular atmosphere.'
, the bishop replied 'No, I don't think I would, because although religion is taken seriously in a Muslim school, I think the particular insight of Islam is not mine.'
Non-Muslims don't want to go to Muslim schools and, increasingly, Muslims won't go to Christian schools,' he said. '
The government could make a start by removing all religious entry requirements from single-faith schools immediately, and then begin the process of returning faith schools to the wider communities that fund them' ( The Guardian 27 September 2005).
We believe that the more religious schools there are, the more children will be separated by religious (and, therefore, often racial, and sometimes sectarian categories) at a very formative time in their lives.
I want my children to sit next to a Sikh in class, play football in the break with a Methodist, do homework with a Hindu and walk to the bus stop with a Muslim before returning to their Jewish home.
We have spent more than a century ridding ourselves of class divisions; why now rush to replace them with religious barriers?'
(Romain 2005)
Work and pensions minister Margaret Hodge, herself a Jewish immigrant, told the Labour think-tank Progress that faith schools should be required to support tolerance and integration. '
We need Ofsted to ensure the curriculum and values of faith schools are consistent with the national curriculum and with promoting tolerance.
The government's 2005 education white paper Higher standards, better schools for all clearly demonstrated that the longer a party remains in power, the more extreme its policies become.
It proposed, among other things, that all schools would be encouraged to become independent state schools ('trust schools') backed by private sponsors, including faith groups.
They would determine their own curriculum and ethos, appoint the governing body, own their own assets, employ their own staff and set their own admissions policy, though they would be required to 'take note of' guidelines on admissions and there would be a pupil banding scheme to ensure a mix of abilities. '
More than a hundred Labour MPs threatened to rebel and 58 of them - including nine former ministers - even published an alternative white paper ( The Guardian 15 December 2005).
In The Guardian Phil Revell sought to explain why the government's determination to create even more faith schools was 'the focus of the biggest backbench backlash since the war on Iraq' (Revell 2006).
He took as his example Canon Slade School, on the Tonge Moor Road in Bolton, a Church of England school with more than 1,700 pupils and consistently good results at GCSE and A Level.
The head, the Reverend Dr Peter Shepherd, wanted the freedom to expand again.
Canon Slade was, said Revell, exactly the kind of school that would become common if the new education bill passed through parliament unscathed.
Back in England, Labour MPs who were worried that church schools were being colonised by middle-class parents feigning religious belief were encouraged when Baroness Morgan, formerly a director of government relations at Number 10, said she felt 'uneasy' about some aspects of admissions to single-faith schools.
White working-class parents who did not want their children educated alongside Bangladeshis had taken refuge in Christian schools, the book argued.
In 2002, for example, four church secondary schools in Tower Hamlets had 3 per cent or fewer Bangladeshi pupils, while three nearby non-faith schools had more than 90 per cent.
The book, The New East End , concluded that the borough's Roman Catholic schools had become 'white citadels', with parents even having their children baptised as Catholics to ensure they got into the right school ( The Observer 12 February 2006).
Religious leaders were clearly becoming anxious about the controversy surrounding faith schools.
In February 2006 representatives of the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, the Muslim Council of Britain, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist organisations signed a declaration that, in addition to teaching their own religion, schools should promote awareness of the 'tenets' of other faiths.
And Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, speaking at the National Church Schools conference in London in March 2006, claimed that faith schools did not exclude any groups but instead played an essential part in developing strong inclusive communities.
However, he went on to urge that faith schools should adopt national criteria for admissions, develop universal principles of teaching about other faiths, and arrange exchanges between schools so that pupils could be exposed to the teachings of other religions ( The Guardian 14 March 2006).
In April 2006 delegates at the NUT's annual conference in Torquay expressed concern at the unprecedented control being gained by fundamentalists in state schools, mainly through the government's academies programme.
