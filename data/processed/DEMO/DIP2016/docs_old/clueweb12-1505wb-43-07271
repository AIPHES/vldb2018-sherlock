For those preferring Jewish day schools, there are choices about the particular religious, cultural or Zionist affiliations of institutions, with schools ranging from Progressive to central Orthodox to strictly Orthodox.
Nonetheless, although the presence of 135 (or 83, according to the DfEE: see Chapter 1 ) Jewish day schools suggests a great deal of choice for parents, the reality is that many of these schools are unavailable to parents because of a variety of factors such as halachic or religious practice criteria, geographical distance, a lack of places or cost.
Even so, planning for future day school needs requires a detailed understanding of the complex ways in which parents choose between different schooling options.
On the basis of in-depth qualitative interviews, four themes emerged as central for parents: academic standards, ethos, geographical location and other added values .
These are presented in the order of importance they were assigned by interviewees, although it is important to note that there is no simple hierarchy of parental wants and requirements.
Parents have differing requirements depending on factors such as their religious observance, whether their child has particular special needs or their geographical distance from a preferred school.
Academic standards
They wouldn't come here if the academic standards weren't high, but they automatically expect Jewish schools to offer high academic standards, so they take that for granted.
(Headteacher of a Jewish primary school)
We chose this school because it has a good standard and because it's a Jewish school.
But, we wouldn't have sent him to a Jewish school if the exam results weren't good enough.
(Parent of a secondary school child)
Most of the parents and education providers interviewed described secular academic standards as very important when choosing their children's schooling.
For many, although other aspects of the school were important, the 'bottom line' was that children had to be able to 'get by in the world', and this requires good academic standards.
This was undoubtedly the case in Progressive and central Orthodox schools, but was also reflected in a number of strictly Orthodox institutions.
Here, several education providers spoke with pride of the secular academic standards their pupils achieved.
While most interviewees accepted the need for the high academic standards, several parents also pointed out how this varies with age, so that, for younger children, being happy was more important than whether or not they were receiving A grades.
Nevertheless, one parent spoke of how the pressures to succeed academically seem to start at a very early age:
The secular, exam side starts getting important by about age nine.
The peer pressure gets enormous, which exams to sit, if your child hasn't been to the best primary school, will they get into the right secondary school?
(Parent of children in non-Jewish primary and secondary schools)
One headteacher believed that the rapid growth in Jewish day schools, at least for mainstream schools, is due in part to recent publicity about high academic standards; parents can send their child to an institution with very good exam results without having to pay the costs of private education: 'It was a bit like sending your child to a private school that is a state school' (parent at a Jewish secondary school).
The introduction of league tables and OFSTED inspection reports is central to this trend, with parents now able to compare performance data for different schools.
This 'market-orientated' approach to education was central to Conservative educational policies of the 1980s and 1990s and has been continued by the present Labour government.
Despite the growth in Jewish day schools, some parents spoke of how they believed that certain private, selective schools were still 'the best', so that 'if you could afford it, that would probably be your choice'.
One regional education professional spoke of a 'tradition' associated with the top independent schools; if parents had been pupils there when they were young, they believed their children should also attend.
Others feared that, if they did not place their child in the independent sector at primary level, they would not be able to obtain a place at secondary level.
Several parents argued that private schools have smaller class sizes and better facilities, and are thus able to give children more individual time and attention.
Such beliefs may also apply to the small number of selective, independent Jewish day schools, although other parents, because they feared that time spent on Jewish studies detracts from the general curriculum, chose an independent, non-Jewish option.
Alongside perceived academic achievement, the principal selling-point for schools was their institutional ethos.
In OFSTED reports from 1996 to 2000, inspectors almost universally praised the ethos of Jewish day schools (see Chapter 4 ).
All schools have their own reputations and traditions, but Jewish schools have, of course, the unique attraction of their particular cultural, Zionist and/or religious associations.
Overall, three aspects of school ethos emerged from the interviews as being of particular importance to parents: s ocial and cultural factors, religious factors and issues of isolationism/multiculturalism .
Social and cultural factors For some parents, it was the social and cultural, rather than the specifically religious, side of Jewish schools that was of most importance.
It was their sense that their children would be educated and grow up 'Jewishly', even if their idea of this was often poorly defined.
Accordingly, one headteacher argued that, while academic results were a major draw at her Jewish school, the other principal attraction was that children would be educated within a Jewish social environment: 'The second reason is the social side, children will make nice friends, turn out well and, by implication, they'll end up marrying someone Jewish: for Jewish parents this was a huge, huge issue�in many cases well beyond the academic.'
Or as the parent of a child attending a Jewish primary school argued:
The cultural aspect was probably more important than the religious side.
We want him to have a large circle of Jewish friends, and all the other schools he looked at would have had a large Jewish element.
Another parent described Jewish day school education as giving her child 'a strong sense of identity': 'Being surrounded by Jewish children gives him a comfort level that is just part of your being.'
Other parents variously described Jewish schooling as providing 'a continuity with home', as an environment in which the school calendar is geared to a Jewish way of life and thinking, and as a place in which a lifelong network of friends and contacts would be created.
One couple also spoke of how the Jewish education of their children feeds back into their own, largely secular lives:
The good thing about our school is that it incorporates the Jewish education for the children at a very early age, which helps us as parents when they're growing up . . . They [the children] keep us in line.
For me, I find they remind me of my upbringing . . . It gives them the real building blocks of Judaism, and it incorporates it into their everyday schooling.
It's not something different, it's just something natural that they're learning.
(Parent at a Jewish primary school)
Other parents described other aspects of the school ethos as important, such as the 'sense of warmth', the 'family feel' to the place or the sense of being 'part of a community', factors not necessarily unique to Jewish schools.
Interestingly, relatively few interviewees mentioned Zionism as an important factor in their decision-making process.
One parent described deliberately choosing a school because of its Zionist affiliations, while another expressed the wish that her children would eventually emigrate to Israel.
However, such views tended to be the exception rather the rule among those interviewed.
Religious factors Alongside the largely social and cultural Jewish factors discussed above, a number of interviewees argued that it was specifically the religious component of the school ethos that attracted them to that particular institution.
Such interviewees unsurprisingly tended to be more observant, and often wanted their offspring to be both fully equipped in religious ways and to socialize principally, or even exclusively, with other religious children:
For me it was important that I felt my children would feel comfortable in many Jewish contexts, that's what sending your children to a Jewish school does�so they'll always be able to daven [pray], they'll always be able to follow a service, so that however far they stray, if they choose to stray, they've got that foundation.
(Strictly Orthodox parent)
This parent was critical of the central Orthodox school that her eldest child had first attended because of its lack of religious vigour: 'They'd never actually held a gemarrah [talmudic religious text] in their hands.'
She argued that, 'in the Orthodox world, the study of texts is the currency, to be able to pick up a text and study it', and that the school had failed in this respect.
Another parent also described how she had originally sent her young son to a central Orthodox Jewish school, but found it extremely awkward when it came to socializing with other children: 'I didn't want my child to feel different at parties, at homes where the kids weren't kosher, parties at McDonald's.
At one school where he went for a time, there was only one other shomer shobbes [strictly observant] person' (strictly Orthodox parent).
Isolationism/multiculturalism While a number of parents spoke positively about the attractions of formal Jewish education, others raised concerns that their children could become too insular and isolated from the 'real world' if they did not mix with those from other religious and cultural backgrounds.
( 1 ) Such fears are partially reflected in concerns raised by OFSTED about some, though certainly not all, Jewish day schools.
Inspectors criticized some schools for not teaching an understanding of different cultural backgrounds: there is a 'restricted range of cultural development' and 'insufficient opportunities for pupils to develop their awareness of other cultures'.
Two parents, whose eldest child had attended a Jewish primary school but was now a pupil at a non-Jewish secondary, believed that it was at this transitional stage in the educational cycle that children had to move away from the 'safety' and 'protection' of a Jewish environment:
I think at that stage, that's where he's got to learn that there's a lot more than just Judaism out there, to mix with non-Jewish people is not a bad thing . . . The world in which we're living in isn't strictly Jewish and it's not good to have them blinkered.
They need to be a bit streetwise and a bit worldly.
Similarly, another parent spoke of fears that her son might have 'less tools to cope with the outside world' if he went to a Jewish school, and that there might be future concerns relating to tolerance and acceptance of others.
This sense of isolation was reflected in the experience of one parent who spoke about the primary school she had attended as a child, when she had been convinced that everyone was Jewish: 'I thought everyone was Jewish, I lived in a Jewish ghetto, everyone I knew was Jewish.'
Interestingly, several interviewees had experience of the Jewish schools in Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow that have non-Jewish children on their rolls, most of them speaking very positively about these institutions.
At these schools, children are able to receive a Jewish education, but they also mix on a day-to-day basis with children from a range of different backgrounds.
Similarly, parents whose children attend non-Jewish schools in which there are also large numbers of other Jews spoke of how they were pleased that their children could, at least in some ways, 'get the best of both worlds'.
In non-Jewish JAMS or Schools' J-Link institutions (see Chapter 3 ), children are, assuming they choose to attend the various cultural and religious activities, able to maintain some formal links with Judaism in their school day, but in an arguably more multicultural environment than many Jewish day schools offer.
Nonetheless, other interviewees were very pleased that their children were away from non-Jewish influences:
I had no fears about isolation from the wider world; it's one of the reasons we sent them to Jewish schools!
Maybe we are isolationist, but we're not isolated from the wider world; they read newspapers.
I don't particularly want them to have friends that are non-Jewish because then we have to go through the whole problem of eating, wanting to go out on Fridays and Saturdays.
We were actually choosing to put barriers round our children, we have deeply held beliefs we were promoting.
Similarly, another parent spoke of how she had attended a non-Jewish primary school as a child and had felt isolated and different, and only when she became a pupil at a Jewish secondary school did she feel happier: 'I felt the kids were more similar to me.'
When she had her own children she was determined that they would not be as isolated as she had been.
Another parent also hinted at a similar thought-process, arguing that the antisemitism he had experienced as a child would not be a part of the education of his offspring.
In this way, the educational background of parents did seem to be an important influencing factor in how schools were chosen.
Indeed, a common theme in many interviews was the negative experiences of parents who had been through the part-time, supplementary ( cheder ) system when they were young, and wanted their children to receive a better Jewish education.
Geographical location
As discussed in Chapter 3 , institutional selection criteria often have strong geographical components.
Nevertheless, there are around seventy other towns and cities in which there are identifiable Jewish populations and that have no Jewish day schools or nurseries.
In a city such as Glasgow, full-time Jewish schooling is available but only up to the end of primary level: there is a small number of Jewish nursery schools, one state-sector Jewish primary school, but no Jewish secondary schools.
In Manchester and (especially) London, parents can�subject to the barriers and limitations discussed in Chapter 3 � choose between different Jewish day schools, and local geographical issues thereby become much more relevant.
Even if parents consider that a particular school has the appropriate academic standards and ethos, the length of time it will take their children to travel there is important.
Several interviewees spoke of how certain schools were 'just too far away', and hence were removed from the decision-making equation.
This is particularly relevant in parts of London where travel time via bus or car is a major issue.
Indeed, the decision to relocate JFS from Camden to Kenton in outer north-west London was based partly on an assumption that parents and children may find the school more accessible.
Interviewees did not reveal any sense of just how far away a school had to be before it was no longer considered, although several parents made clear that distances mattered more at primary than at secondary level: parents were more uncomfortable in having their children travel long distances when they were younger.
Other parents were concerned that if their children did not live in the immediate geographical vicinity of schools, their children would find it difficult to socialize with school friends at the end of the day; being geographically remote might mean their children being separated from after-school friendship networks.
Alternatively, the success of some schools�such as the King Solomon High School in the Redbridge area of London�is in part due to its convenient location and ability to 'tap' the local market, so that Redbridge parents want to send their children to the local school.
Factors such as sporting and IT facilities, music teaching and extracurricular activities, which were often not considered a high priority in the overall parental decision-making process, were still thought to be important for their children's education.
It gave them a lot of confidence in ways that weren't necessarily academic; it gave the kids a rich, happy educational experience . . . At primary level I would be looking for the added value that the SATs [Standard Attainment Tests] don't express, like the music, the relationship between staff and pupils . . . special needs, how those children were educated.
(Parent of secondary school-age children)
This chapter explores day school education principally from a user's perspective, examining how and why Jewish parents make the decision to choose one school over another.
This is set within the context of a doubling of attendance figures at Jewish day schools over the past twenty years (see Chapter 1 ), which means that, while some 25 per cent of the parental generation were themselves pupils at Jewish day schools, around 50 per cent of current Jewish children attend such schools.
Half of all parents who send their children to Jewish day schools thus have no first-hand experience of these institutions.
Parents have to decide�often in conjunction with their children�whether they prefer Jewish schools, non-Jewish schools in which there are many other Jews and that may have a JAMS or Schools' J-Link programme, or non-Jewish schools in which there are few or no other Jewish pupils.
I like him learning about the festivals, but if he were in a non-Jewish school he wouldn't take most of them off.
