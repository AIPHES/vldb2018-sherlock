To make mandatory in the schools a program whose catechism is diametrically opposed to the understanding of most traditionally religious people, let alone most parents, is an outrageous challenge to the rights of the citizens and means that what many parents are teaching their children at home is being directly contradicted and undermined by what is going on in the classroom.
In spite of Mr. Ramsey's rhetoric about how much 'choice' there is in public education in B.C., the highly controversial CAPP program is now mandatory for high school graduation, leaving no options for parents, or students for that matter, who have reservations about the content and direction this program takes.
To make mandatory in all schools in B.C. a program whose catechism is diametrically opposed to the understanding of most traditionally religious people, let alone most parents, is an outrageous challenge to the rights of the citizens of this province and means that what many parents are teaching their children at home is being directly contradicted and undermined by what is going on in the classroom.
Just as non-religious parents expect that their children will not be indoctrinated by religious teaching in the public schools, those parents who hold religious views ought to be able to expect that their children will not be indoctrinated with views that contradict their own deeply held religious beliefs.
If our educational system is to fairly represent the cultural differences of a diverse population, (which surely it is meant to do) parents from different backgrounds and perspectives need much more input into the development of these programs, and the right to either opt out of existing programs, or the choice of optional programs which better match their own philosophies.
In the meantime, traditional religious people in this province are nervously reading many different signs coming out of Victoria and wondering whether we are not now entering a new era of religious persecution, one in which traditional religious voices are to be increasingly and aggressively marginalized and stifled by the provincial government.
This government needs to be reminded that its duty is to serve and represent all the people of this province, even those of us so out of date that we believe educational policies which limit the moral vision of students to a notion of 'personal autonomy' and 'self-esteem' actually deprive them of the moral energy and moral context they need to develop into men and women of real character.
