Any program holidays will be announced in the newsletter and the Order of Service announcements.
Please introduce yourself and your child to the staff and group leaders, and complete a visitor form.
Parents who possess an attitude of cheerful expectancy about weekly church attendance have less difficulty keeping children involved.
We encourage you to learn along with your child as you take a spiritual journey together.
Recognize that your child's religious needs may differ from your own.
Many children have a need for ritual, structure, and definitive answers to difficult questions.
Although you are your children's primary religious educator, you are not alone!
Religious Education Committee (REC)
The REC is the body which works in conjunction with the Director of Religious Education (DRE) to oversee the Religious Education program.
We welcome your input, feedback, and participation.
