Hot lunches are provided at the school and parents may be asked to volunteer to help with various school services.
In order to enroll and/or learn more about the parochial schools in your area, check with appropriate religious organizations under "Schools" in the yellow pages of the telephone directory.
Acceptable reasons for absence are: sickness, sickness or death in the family, and religious holidays.
Hot lunches are available for purchase or your child may bring a lunch from home.
