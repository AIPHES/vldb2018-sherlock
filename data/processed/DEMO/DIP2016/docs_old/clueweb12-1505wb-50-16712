While the number of Jewish day schools has grown rapidly over the past half-century, and pupils in these schools are largely achieving good academic examination results compared to the national average, a series of key strategic issues still face the overall Jewish schooling sector.
On the basis of in-depth interviews with both education providers (headteachers, teachers, educational psychologists and community professionals) and education users (parents), five strategic themes concerning Jewish day schools were identified: provision of places, human resources, financing, communication and information and special educational needs .
This chapter discusses the first four of these themes, which are presented in a hierarchy of importance, beginning with the most pressing communal issues of provision of Jewish day school places and whether there are enough teachers, and going on to less immediate�though still important�concerns, such as how schools communicate with parents.
The chapter concentrates on these themes for 'mainstream' Progressive and central Orthodox schools.
Chapter 7 discusses strategic issues facing the strictly Orthodox sector, which has particular needs and concerns, and Chapter 8 analyses provision for children with special educational needs.
SEN is an area that has largely been neglected in Jewish education reports, and requires particular communal attention.
Questions as to whether there is over- or under-provision of Jewish day school places continue to worry Jewish community leaders concerned with education.
In some regional communities, concerns are expressed over whether the local Jewish day school can attract enough Jewish pupils to remain viable in the long term, whereas in parts of London there are questions as to whether or not the supply of places can keep up with demand.
At primary level, there is a range of Jewish day schools in the north London area, from Progressive schools, such as Clore Shalom and Akiva, to central Orthodox schools, such as Rosh Pinah and Hertsmere, to the strictly Orthodox schools like Pardes House and Yesodey Hatorah.
Nonetheless, a number of north London interviewees spoke of the difficulties of obtaining places at their preferred primary school:
At [our primary school] people were fighting to get in.
(Governor of a London Jewish primary school)
For schools that are in demand�and thus have to 'ration' places�selection criteria are based on factors such as halachic status, prior attendance at a Jewish nursery, the presence of a sibling in the school and geographical proximity (see Chapter 3 ).
Parents who want to send their children to Jewish schools but do not meet the necessary criteria�because, for example, they may have just moved to the area�face the prospect of settling for their second- or third-choice school.
At secondary level there are no specifically Progressive schools and a small number of central Orthodox Jewish schools, although institutions tend to be larger than at primary level.
Here again, fears of an over-subscription of places were often expressed.
The Jewish Free School (JFS) is preparing to move site and expand, and Progressive and Orthodox steering groups have been established to discuss the possibility of constructing one, or possibly even two, new secondary schools north of Greater London in Hertfordshire.
Several providers and users at both primary and secondary levels noted how most schools have particular constituencies and niche markets.
Accordingly, while there is a qualitative perception among certain education providers of a need to expand the provision of Jewish day school places in north London, some providers noted a more stable demand in terms of their particular religious constituency.
At one school, for example, the headteacher argued that the 'market' for potential pupils was relatively steady, but noted pressures to move to the 'right' in terms of religious observance; while this might potentially attract more pupils it would also entail, from this headteacher's perspective, an unacceptable alteration to the ethos of the school.
Broad statements about an over- or under-provision of places are thus unhelpful, even in London.
Outside London, the provision of Jewish day school places is patchier although, as in London, schools are often associated with particular religious, cultural or Zionist traditions.
Interviewer: Where do you think your school will be in ten years' time?
Such schools have to 'sell' themselves to local Jews, who may be deciding between the local Jewish state school and often an independent, non-Jewish school.
Such schools thus seek to 'recruit' Jewish pupils.
For those not part of central Orthodox Jewry, the situation in declining regional Jewish communities is arguably even more difficult.
For example, in Glasgow, parents in the small Progressive community can choose to send their children to the local Jewish primary school, although the education there is based on a central Orthodox ethos, which may not always sit comfortably with those from different affiliations.
While minority Jewish populations in London have the option�places permitting�of educating their children in primary day schools specifically designed to meet their needs, in regional communities this is usually not possible.
Human resources
General subject teachers Alongside the issue of whether or not there is adequate provision of Jewish day school places, the issue most often raised by interviewees�by providers and users�related to human resources.
In general, most interviewees were extremely positive about the staff working in the Jewish schools, with parents mostly happy or very happy with the education their children were receiving (although some found it difficult to rate the quality of their school because of a lack of comparative information).
It is important to stress these positive attitudes, while also identifying areas of concern, such as those relating to the difficulty of recruiting general teaching staff.
Most of the Jewish schools are pretty full.
We need more Jewish schools, but an even bigger problem is the staffing of Jewish schools when we get them.
We advertised for two posts recently and were shocked by how few applicants there were . . . There are very few people around that are good Jewish teachers that we don't already know about, and that's very sad.
(London primary school headteacher)
Teacher recruitment problems are common to many UK schools�especially in London and the South-east�the Jewish sector of which is obviously just one part.
Data from the Department for Education and Employment show that Jewish schools have slightly smaller class sizes and lower pupil to teacher ratios than the national average (see Chapter 4 ).
Hence, Jewish schools are arguably in a better position than most.
Note that, according to the DfEE, there are 288 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers in state-sector Jewish primary schools and 270 FTE teachers in state-sector Jewish secondary schools.
Nevertheless, a key sectoral problem for Jewish day schools is attracting Jewish members of staff.
This is particularly so because many schools who are happy to employ non-Jewish staff will only accept Jewish teachers if they are religiously observant because of a desire that they be role models.
Having Jewish teachers here is almost a prerequisite.
Even in schools in which the Judaic and general curricula are separated, a shortage of Jewish teachers is still a matter of concern.
If the raison d'�tre of Jewish day schools is to immerse children in a Jewish way of life, having few Jewish teachers in general curriculum classes gives pupils a different message:
If [Jewish general curriculum staff] can be recruited, they have a major impact on the religious ethos and vibrancy of a Jewish secondary school.
They demonstrate to pupils that religious commitment is not incompatible with secular excellence and that it is not determined by one's formal position in the school.
In this sense a religious teacher of physics may provide as salient a role model as, say, the Head of Jewish Studies.
Conversely, if sincere Jewish observance is restricted to the Jewish studies department, the message being sent to the pupils is clear.
Judaic subject teachers Alongside general recruitment difficulties, Jewish day schools also suffer particular human resource problems in relation to the recruitment and retention of suitably qualified Jewish studies and modern Hebrew ( Ivrit ) staff.
Getting general staff was not a problem.
To get Jewish studies staff was a constant headache, not just for us, but for all the Jewish schools.
One Jewish studies teacher in a central Orthodox London secondary school spoke of how several of his departmental colleagues had left in the previous academic year, and that trying to replace them was proving difficult; while the school had received applications for the posts, none was considered suitable.
There are problems of financial incentives, a schoolteacher doesn't earn as much as if you wanted to go into law or accountancy.
Part of it is perception, that you couldn't do anything else so you went into teaching; the esteem of teachers is not very good.
It's also to do with the training within the community, the encouragement within the community for more people to involve themselves in Jewish education.
Historically, Judaic subjects have been staffed on a different basis to secular studies, with Jewish studies and Hebrew teachers being supernumerary, with salaries paid for out of parental contributions and grants from charitable foundations.
Jewish studies staff have often been local rabbis or have come from yeshivot or seminaries, while Hebrew teachers have typically been Israeli teachers with no qualifications for teaching the subject as a foreign language.
Problems relating to the recruitment and retention of Jewish studies staff are well known among Jewish communal leaders, and a number of educational human resource strategies have now been designed to begin addressing the problems.
The JTTP offers a Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) that leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS); the Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) that leads to a degree and QTS; and the School Centred Initial Teacher Training Programme (SCIT) designed for graduates wanting to complete a one-year Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) course for primary level.
To get more Jewish studies teachers, we should engage in a big recruitment and training programme, maybe take fifty key young people between the ages of 18 and 23 who are inspired to be in Jewish education . . . engage them in some training in Israel for a couple of years, then create the opportunities for them to be involved in different levels of Jewish education.
Encourage people to start off in a career in Jewish education.
We would have to entice them by saying there'd be certain scholarships or bursaries given to them in their first few years of employment.
There's talented people out there who aren't getting involved.
Parents were also aware of the difficulties of recruiting suitably qualified Jewish studies staff.
For example, one parent complained that the only lesson his son gets into trouble in was Jewish studies, because the teacher could not control the class and so was constantly handing out after-school detentions.
Another secondary school parent in a more religious school was worried about teachers emerging straight out of seminaries with inadequate skills and experience:
I am concerned about the young, unqualified teachers, the Jewish studies teachers.
My daughter has been inspired by some of her Jewish studies teachers, but there are teachers who come with very poor management skills, class-management skills that she homes in on immediately.
The Pikuach report into standards of Judaic education assessed the teaching of Jewish studies in Jewish schools as mostly 'sound', and in half the cases as 'good'.
( 4 ) Nonetheless, the report acknowledged variations in teaching standards between schools, identified problems such as resource shortages and a need for 'many more training opportunities for teachers of Jewish studies at all levels and in all schools'.
( 5 ) Moreover, the lack of a shared curriculum means that there is no comparative framework for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Judaic teaching across the range of Jewish day schools.
We tried to find him a Jewish school in Hendon, but waiting lists were horrendous.
In Leeds, there are on-going discussions about a possible Jewish state secondary school, but in many regional communities questions are being raised�if sometimes only tacitly� about the long-term future of formal Jewish schooling.
One parent/governor at an Orthodox primary school argued that Jewish studies was taught to an extremely high standard, while another parent stated that the Jewish studies taught was 'Okay, just not very exciting'.
Because education works as a series of systems (as discussed in Chapter 3 ), difficulties in attracting younger or less experienced teachers inevitably lead to problems in recruiting headteachers, senior managers and departmental heads in later years.
Headteachers are key to the tone, ethos and educational standards of schools, and governors have to make difficult decisions about how traditional or modern potential candidates are, as well as about their religious and educational commitments and capabilities.
In terms of governance, the recent JPR report by Margaret Harris and Colin Rochester emphasized the high level of commitment shown by members of Jewish governing bodies.
Nevertheless, it also raised problems concerning the general recruitment of volunteers for lay-leadership positions, religious differences intensifying competition for new recruits, a shortage of younger volunteers and difficulties related to the length of time that certain key individuals stay within their posts.
( 6 ) As Chapter 4 showed, key individuals in governance roles can have a major impact on academic success and the environment of schools.
However, this also raises questions about the relative power of individuals and communal agencies as opposed to the parents and pupils who are the service users, and arguably the key stakeholders, of schools (see Chapter 10 ).
For schools that are also under-subscribed, competition for children�and hence issues of marketing�are of crucial importance to the financial survival of institutions.
These statements can be divided into two distinct themes: first, parental perceptions of their interactions with the school; second, how they perceive the standard of education their children are receiving.
Range in school averages
For some of the parents interviewed, the sense of being in a partnership with their school was clearly evident.
Nonetheless, other parents expressed more disquiet.
Jewish parents are not backwards in coming forward.
