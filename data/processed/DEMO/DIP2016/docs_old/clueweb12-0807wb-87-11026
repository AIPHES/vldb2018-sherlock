The Columbus Public Schools has alternative schools which differ from conventional schools in the way subjects are taught or in the focus of the instruction (arts, sciences, or foreign languages, for example.)
It is important to realize that few alternative public schools offer English as a Second Language classes.
In order to enroll at an alternative school for the fall, parents must complete an application and submit it to the Alternative School Office.

The philosophies of the schools vary greatly so parents should visit the school and read about its philosophy before enrolling their children.
When you leave Columbus, a letter should be sent to the child's teacher or to the principal giving the exact date of withdrawal.
If you would enjoy helping with school activities or want to share information about your culture, let your child's principal or teacher know at the beginning of the year.
