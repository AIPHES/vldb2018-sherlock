Events that have been organized by the Parents Association in the past include Shabbat dinners and holiday celebrations, informal gatherings in the homes of congregants and the annual Purim Carnival.
Our hope is that for every class in the school, one or two parents will volunteer to serve as "class parents," supporting the participation of other families in their grade and also providing a means by which all parents may voice suggestions and concerns about our programs.
The agenda of the Parent Association is set by the Parents Association Steering Committee .
For the 2010-2011 school year, the steering committee is: Sacha Grutman, Pamela Selin, Sarah Janover and Elaine Friedman.
Their primary concern is to build community among the families of the school and the synagogue.
ur Religious School has had a long history of active parent participation and dedication.
The Religious School Parents Association is the forum for parents to work with the clergy and the staff of the Department of Lifelong Learning to plan, publicize and run activities for synagogue families of Religious School age.
