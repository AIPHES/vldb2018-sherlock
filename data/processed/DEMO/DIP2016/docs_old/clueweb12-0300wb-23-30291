YRUU offers the youth of our church a balanced program to support them in their continued personal growth and religious exploration.
The five components of the program include worship, community building, social action, learning and leadership.
There are three main parts to the YRUU structure at TVUUC: a Sunday morning church school class, a Wednesday evening youth group and the Youth Adult Committee (YAC), which coordinates the programming and activities for this age group.
We encourage all of our high school youth to find ways to be active in the congregation and our High School program.
Typically, participants who do not wish to present a credo statement may communicate their findings in other ways: for example, a choreographed dance or a musical piece they have written.
This year, parents are required to be active participants in the work of our Youth Group.
High school is a time when teens are seeking to better understand and strengthen their personal beliefs and their relationship to church, to school, to friends and to family.
