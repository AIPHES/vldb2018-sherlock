Concern Over Muslim Prayer in West Shore Schools Raises Questions About How Districts Respond to Students' Religious Needs
Spokesman Ryan Argot quoted policies regarding religious expression, but would not comment on whether Muslim students were being excused from class to pray or whether the district is considering such an option.
And last year, at least one Muslim student left Red Land High School in the district partly because she was not allowed to leave class to pray.
The district solicitor did not return a phone call, and school board members did not respond to email requests.
The U.S. Department of Education website explains in greater detail what constitutes allowed religious expression, including that schools "may excuse students from class to remove a significant burden on their religious exercise, where doing so would not impose material burdens on other students."
She did not want her name used because she said she feared repercussions to her family's business.
The woman noted that the district stopped hosting baccalaureate services last year, and she said students are not allowed to sing religiously-based songs at the holiday concert.
"It's accommodating one religion in lieu of all the others," she said of Muslim prayer.
For instance, the Dec. 19 concert for Cedar Cliff High School included "Ava Maria," a medley of traditional Christmas carols and the Christian hymn "In Dulci Jublio."
"You have these very vocal minorities making it hell for the majority," she said.
She is now being cyber-schooled at home.
"Islam teaches there is no coercion in religion," Mabashir Mumtaz said.
Students in the West Shore are also now allowed to wear clothing with religious messages or other personal expressions after a 2010 lawsuit filed by the family of a student who had been asked to turn his anti-abortion T-shirt inside-out.
