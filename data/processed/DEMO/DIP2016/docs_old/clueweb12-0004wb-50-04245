I am interested in sending my son to a Jewish day school.
I am wondering what people thought of Oakland Hebrew Day school vs. Tehiyah Day School.
If you have recommendations of either individually that is great or a comparison if you looked at both and choose one.
I am also interested in knowing if a family who does not observe Shabbat would fit in at Oakland Hebrew Day School.
Thank you for your help.
-looking for a good Jewish education
My daughter attended Tehiyah from 5th-8th grades.
We were not a particularly observant family and fit in fine there.
There is great diversity at Tehiyah in terms of Jewish observance, beliefs, political views.
It was an incredible experience, both for my daughter and our entire family.
I can't recommend the school enough.
Also, because of the tremendous range of Jewish identities and beliefs, the children learn very quickly what true tolerance means.
As for Oakland Hebrew Day, I have no first hand experience with them.
From reputation, they are more orthodox, probably a narrower range of beliefs and practices represented at the school.
Feel free to contact me directly for more information about Tehiyah.
sb Don't want to beat a dead horse about Tehiyah, but I will say that the academics, emotional environment, administration, and teachers--all great.
The parent population is very invested and supportive, as well.
Strong, strong sense of community.
I had an older child (now in private high school) who wasn't particularly happy socially at Tehiyah, but as he is socially awkward, he would have been miserable elsewhere.
I felt that he was very protected at Tehiyah, emotionally/socially.
My younger son is delighted with Tehiyah and even protests staying home when he is sick.
There are non-Jewish and interfaith families at Tehiyah who are completely comfortable, there, as well.
Finally, we have an up and coming basketball team, and a GREAT!

Re: School for 3rd grader with Selective Mutism You didn't ask about other schools so I will suggest a school that may (or may not) fit the bill for you.
My child attends Tehiyah (and got into all of the other private schools, as well).
Re: Neighborhood Public School vs. Jewish Day School I think that Tehiyah Day School is a very welcoming and warm place.
It is blessed with incredibly talented and loving teachers, and an administration who is not above hearing parent/child input.
What is also nice about Tehiyah, also, is that it pulls from the spectrum behaviorally and economically.
The children, overall, seem very precocious, and the school seems to be able to ''service'' children with various learning disabilities, as well.
A nice testimonial to the school's appeal/success is that non-Jews attend because it is a very special place.
And, finally, from what I've seen of other schools, public and private, Tehiyah hits the middle of the homework spectrum--not too much and not too little.
It is a very special place, and of the kids who graduated last year who applied to private high school, all got their 1st and/or second choice school.
February 1999
Our son is in first grade there.
We're an interfaith family, also not very observant.
We are extremely happy with the school.
Kathleen In response to the parent asking about Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito: all of my five stepchildren attended, or are still attending, Tehiyah at this time.
I have had direct contact with the school for about two years, and am, in general, very impressed with the school's committment to both a strong secular curriculum and a Jewish studies curriculum.
I have not felt that any particular level of ritual/religious observance is preferred, although my family is definitely on the observant side vis-a-vis the student body as a whole.
I have found the teachers, with few exceptions, to be very committed and involved with the students, at all levels.
The middle school core curriculum closely follows the state-defined framework.
The school principal, Steve Taback, takes an active interest in the students and seems very accessible to me.
The kids are expected to function at a very high level academically, but I do not get a sense from my step-kids or the teachers that strong and unproductive competition among the students is a problem.
My major concern has to do with the limited opportunities the kids are afforded to meet kids of other backgrounds.
Just about all the kids at Tehiyah are from middle to upper middle class backgrounds, Jewish, and most pretty liberal and/or progressive.
I think it gives the kids a somewhat warped vision of the world, as would any educational environment in which most of the kids have a similar background.
Another concern is that most of the middle school kids go on to private high schools which perpetuate closely the same environment as Tehiyah, but my step-kids go on to Berkeley High School.
My 16 year old stepson (10th grade) has found the adjustment process difficult and a bit frightening.
Few of his Tehiyah classmates went on to B.H.S., and so he did not have much of a peer group to rely on, and really didn't know a lot of other Berkeley kids.
For my stepdaughter (7th grade), I suggested that she be put in a regular Berkeley middle school, to ease the adjustment, but she is still at Tehiyah.
She is not the same self-starter her older brother is, nor is she as strong a student, and I fear that she will be lost in the huge, multicultural, complex society of B.H.S. I believe parents should consider this situation before sending children to any small, private school with a fairly homogeneous population.
Despite my concerns, I highly recommend Tehiyah, and if my husband and I do have a child of our own, we would choose to send that child to Tehiyah, although I would be in favor of a public middle school if public high school is a likely outcome and we perceive that our child would have a difficult adjustment.
I am recommending Tehiyah Day School very highly.
My 20 year old daughter went there and she is now in college and I have an 11 year son there in the 6th grade.
The teachers are highly academic and very loving and caring.
While it is true that Tehiyah has had some difficult times with directors, we just lost our Dr. Singer to cancer a couple months ago, it seems that the continuity of the school is due to the wonderful teachers.
I don't know what else to say in general.
In any event, you can't go wrong choosing Tehiyah Day School.
There are many interfaith couples, and while the children get the Jewish culture, it is pretty secular.
The non-Jewish parent is made to feel pretty welcome.
Tehiyah is a safe environment for your child.
Also, my daughter is at Stanford, so Tehiyah must have done something right.
I am struck by Tehiyah's willingness to take children who are all over the learning and behavioral spectrum; it's amazing, since a lot of schools seem to have their radar up for only ''easy'' children.
It would be a pity for apathy and assimilation to succeed in doing what anti-Semitism has failed to do over the past many centuries.
To me the key seems to be in knowing and understanding Jewish traditions so they can help propel us forward in our own lives and in the realm of Jewish thinking itself.
In short, we have found Tehiyah to be a dynamic, understanding, and supportive school where our kids can learn to keep Jewish traditions alive while they personally thrive!!!

I welcome anyone thinking of sending their kids to Tehiyah Day School to contact me.
I am a very happy parent of two very happy kids.
My boys are now in first grade, and are thriving in every way.
The academics are strong, and they learn conflict resolution skills, but most of all, the sense of community is wonderful.
You do not have to be Jewish (or religious) to go to Tehiyah!
The community is based on shared values of learning and giving back to the world.
Every morning the kids start their day with Modeh Ani, which includes music and singing.
It's really a terrific place.
If you have any questions and want to hear a parents' perspective, please feel free to email me.
I'd love to hear reviews of Tehiya from current parents.
Listings in the archive are from last year and earlier.
What are the plusses and minuses of the school?
How do people deal with living far from school?
Thank you!
Seriously Considering Tehiya
Can't help you with the distance although there is a school bus from Oakland that many children take and that seems to be fine.
Older kids take AC transit.
There are many wonderful teachers and also some who are just OK.
Academics are fine but not perfect which would probably be the case at any school.
Both the Hebrew program and Music are the weakest links, but other subjects seem to be fine.
I like the way that Jewish culture is transmitted as it truly gives something significant to the children.
Purim alone is worth the tuition!
Families who attend reflect a range of religiosity, from completely secular to a few more orthodox, with most somewhere in the middle.
The kids there seem happy and Tehiyah gives them a good grounding from which to depart.
Tehiyah Mom Mt twins started at Tehiyah Day School this year and I have been extremely satisfied at every level.
That was before school even started.
Kindergarten began gently, with short days the first week and full length days the second, a sensitive strategy which helped my children adjust from pre-school to ''big kids' school'' without trauma.
This Friday the children will celebrate their 100th day of school.
They now come home and teach me Hebrew words.
One of my children read me Hop On Pop for Chanukah.
They are excited about learning, asking for math problems to do in the car and proud when they get the answers right.
The work papers they bring home from school show me how much they are learning academically as well as socially.
My shyer child is finally having play dates with peers.The Second Step Program that the school has recently implemented helps the classmates manage conflict and learn about emotions.
Finally, the extended community has been warm, welcoming, and supportive.
They celebrated the birth of my kindergardeners'new siblings with us, and extended themselves in every way they could to help our family with many transitions.
We have felt blessed to be there.
Oh, I'm delighted to be a Tehiyah parent!
My child loves it.
Can't wait to go to school.
Pluses: Warm, welcoming community.
Plenty of laughter.
Morning all-school meeting with lots of spirit and smiles.
Small classes with wonderful teachers (both 3rd grade teachers are amazing, as are the two 2nd grade teachers).
Kindergarten is excellent - a loving environment.
The children don't seem to carry around a lot of ''attitude''.
Rather, they are happy, playful, and surprisingly insightful.
The 8th graders have repeatedly impressed me by their academic abilities and kindness towards the younger students.
There's a superb library that the children are encouraged to use.
The art program is excellent as well.
The male gym teacher towers over everyone and is loved by all.
Strong emphasis on critical discussion of events and history.
Hebrew is taught at the intro through advanced levels.
Jewish thought runs through the school, but you need not be Jewish to attend.
Mainly, have a Jewish sense of humor.
Minuses: The lower classes haven't figured out how to teach arithmetic ... they've started ''Singapore Math'' which is drill- to-kill style of math teaching.
A weekly ''Second Step'' program is supposed to teach children how to relate to each other.
My child says it's boring, stupid, and filled with psychobabble.
The children pretty much recognize it as a politically-correct waste of an hour a week.
Tuition just jumped 9 percent (to about $15,000) because of the expensive gymnasium.
The teachers didn't get a raise.
Getting there...
There's a bus that picks up around Albany and central Berkeley.
But it is probably a difficult car commute from Oakland, although plenty of parents do it.
One child is graduating this year.
Tehiyah's written mission is ''committed to serving a diverse student body'' and that diversity is reflected in the classroom.
The teacher's job is to reach all these kids.
Depending on the range of abilities and the size of the class, the teacher can tailor the math curriculum to the class.
There is a very good learning specialist on staff, who is fluent in Hebrew, a definite plus at Tehiyah.
The school psychologist, Ken Benau, is bright, personable and very intuitive, as well as insightful.
Most important, the teachers are absolutely on board in terms of recognizing and supporting learning differences.
Steve Tabak, the head of Tehiyah, was my son's 7th grade math teacher and was both great in supporting my son, and in really getting the 7th grade mentality (and enjoying it!)
What you get at Tehiyah, that you cannot get at almost any other school, is a deep emergence into moral and spiritual issues, in action and in intellectual study.
Other than some interesting discussions about faith and Santa Claus, she has had no problems being a non- Jewish student.
It has enabled her to widen her cultural context, think about her own beliefs and to really explore diversity.
She is also the only Native American/ Chicana/ Irish kid I know who is learning to speak Hebrew!
I am impressed with Tehiyah's committment to each, individual child; meeting them where they are.
My daughter is truly thriving at this school.
We are not Jewish, and I was initially concerned about my daughter not feeling included.
The opposite has been true.
We are now at Tehiyah Day School.
My son is in 3rd grade, and my daughter in 1st.
We are extremely happy there.
We are a Jewish family, and are very active in the Jewish community, so it is a huge benefit to us that Tehiyah had been able to meet our needs academically.
I will note that in Kindergarten, our son's teacher made many efforts to give him advanced projects, but he often spurned them because he wanted to do what the rest of the class was doing.
We have been pleased to discover several good partners for our son at Tehiyah -- kids who can keep up with him, inspire him, and challenge him in many ways.
I would be happy to discuss our experience at Tehiyah further, if you have any questions.

Re: Portola Middle School In response to the concerned Portola parent, while I can't speak for the school, I can offer a suggestion for a fantastic private middle school.
My son attends Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito and has had incredible teachers, a challenging and thoughtful curriculum, small class size, a great group of friends and a wonderful community of families.
I encourage you to check out the school; it is a very special place!
I have 2 kids at Tehiyah's middle school, and I am thrilled with it.
When I first visited the school, the admissions director took me to the daily morning assembly, where the entire school gathers for about 10 minutes of singing and community.
She introduced me to a few 7th and 8th graders, who looked me in the eye and greeted me warmly.
I was so impressed.
The school values kids, encourages those who model good civic and (and civil) comportment, and emphasizes community at every opportunity.
I have not been disappointed for one day.

They are accepting of people with a wide variety of beliefs; they are proud and happy to be Jewish; they have wonderful friends; and they have had incredibly involved and supportive teachers.
We live in Oakland and have not had any issues with our kids riding the school bus.
The bus driver is incredibly responsible, reliable and makes it her job to get to know the kids; she has been driving the Tehiyah bus, I believe, for well over 15 years.
We are in a carpool with another family and this way our kids get a ride home 2 to 3 days a week.
We take the carpool lane and I kid you not, can be home in less than 20 minutes!
However, keep in mind that there may be more diversity at Tehiyah (different types of families, all levels of religious observance) than at OHDS.
My son who is now in high school had a stellar education and my other son is in 4th grade and is truly happy.
Tehiyah has a wonderful way of focusing on the 'whole' student, focusing not only on academic achievement but on the student's social and emotional well being.
As well, the school manages, along with parents, to instill a sense of moral and behavioral rectitude.
The school's inclusive and accepting nature has created a situation whereby some children's needs would be better served by another school.
I do think that kids end up reflecting their parents' values so it's not a big issue for our child that we don't belong to a synagogue.
Politically,vis a vis Israel, the school is pretty mainstream but again, there are those of us who are very progressive on the question of Israel and Zionism.
Plus there are alot of wonderful teachers and parents as well.
As well, families seem to practice varying degrees of the Jewish religion.
We have connected with many families over the years.
jm There are so many reasons to applaud the kind of education taking place at Tehiyah Day School, a K-8, a private Jewish Day School in the El Cerrito hills, that I thought I would just list some of them.
My son is in the 4th grade and has loved this school from the minute he arrived for his kindergarten visit.
Tehiyah presents a stimulating Judaic education which honors diversity of practice; the Judaic studies teachers are wonderful, and children are speaking, reading and writing in Hebrew very early on...The best part of the program is the unmitigated joy the teachers bring to celebration and respect for Jewish study and heritage, all under the guidance of Rabbi Tsipi Gabai, a spectacular head of Jewish Studies.
The community, with the help of an anonymous million dollar gift from a Tehiyah family, built a multipurpose gymnasium that has been used for everything from sports to school celebrations to its book fair and graduation and school play.
The building includes a Bet Midrash for Torah services and Jewish studies, a kitchen, a beautiful music room and other multipurpose spaces that have transformed the school into a home away from home.
I discovered during our school search last year that we were choosing a school not only for our son but for our entire family (including our 2 1/2 year old).
I strongly suggest that you call the admissions director, Ms. Amy Utstein, to answer any questions and to get a tour.
Come take a look and talk to some of the teachers and parents at the kindergarten information night on October 28th.
Rather than focusing on the practice of religion, the emphasis is on Jewish values and culture.
Academic work is a priority in the curriculum.
What we both agreed on was that we did not want a religious education per se, nor did we want any particular ideology thrown at them.
What we wanted, and what we got at Tehiyah, was a diverse community of Jews and non-Jews, a first-class education, emphasis on social responsibility, and a tolerance for all levels of religiousness.
Every morning, the children begin the day by gathering together and singing songs � it�s beautiful and moving.
It�s this spirit of community at Tehiyah that gives my children, and me, a sense of place in the world.
As a kind of ''pick and choose'' Jew who embraces some rituals and beliefs and not others � I feel entirely embraced and welcomed by the Tehiyah community.
If you�d like to talk more, I�m happy to answer any questions you have.
For the secular Jewish mom married to an atheist that wants a religious framework for her kids, here's a late reply.
My husband and I share the same goals, ethics and principles as you and your husband do, regarding our kids.
Before we married, we agreed to raise our children Jewish.
My husband was okay with it because he's not ecstatic about some of the hypocrisies of his religion.
My family went to Temple on high holy days and that was about it aside from a one-two year try with Shabbat and Hebrew school.
I wanted my kids to have more information about their heritage as well as religion.
We found the best of all worlds at Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito.
Our kids have Judaism class, and Hebrew class as well as all the regular academics--math, science, P.E., art, music, etc.
In the regular course of their academics, they learn about other religions.
It teaches about it informatively but does not ''ram it down kids' throats.''
They learn and then appreciate what they learn and appreciate their Jewishness, for lack of a better word.
They get the opportunity to learn about Judaism while still practicing their own religion.
For me personally, reconnecting with a Jewish community (in a progressive minded context) has been a visceral experience.
It has an intangible resonance that I can not name, but I am so grateful to have happened upon.
There is something incredible about starting each school day with everyone (K-8) coming together and singing (mostly Hebrew, some English) to greet the new day.
Scientific thinking and archeology are added to the mix and the emphasis is placed on figuring out what is it that we can learn from Torah stories that is valuable in our own lives.
Honoring the concepts of tikkun olam and tzadaka are also omnipresent parts of the underlying essence of Tehiyah.
I'm not sure if you have had any other private school ''assessments'' yet but I just wanted to let you know that not all kindergarten ''assessments'' are like the one you have just described.
I was also told and was comforted by the message that if it was just ''one of those days'' then the kindergarten teachers would visit the preschool to see him in his familiar and comfortable environment.
One can volunteer in some of the classrooms, take an adult Hebrew class, participate in parent education forums, as well as join one of the many volunteer commitees throughout the school.
The teachers are extraordinarily dedicated and many have taught at the school for 10 years or longer.
My daughter feels that Tehiyah is her home away from home and my husband and I are very happy to have found a great school that welcomes our involvement and where our daughter is thriving.
They are now in first grade at Tehiyah, a Jewish Day school in El Cerrito, and are thriving in every way.
There are kids at the school who are not Jewish.
It's not new agey.
It definitely is community oriented.
One of the things I like best is that when I need help, a favor, whatever, there is someone I can call, someone I can trust.
Whether it's a teacher, a parent, a staff person.
We are one big community that is here for each other.
So hope this bit of information helps.
At that point we were not actively looking for the Jewish aspects of the school, but once we found ourselves there we became delighted with the Jewish cultural values and community.
What we have found is a pluralistic Jewish community that feels Berkeley-ish in its openness.
There are families with all sorts of backgrounds and approaches to Judaism, spirituality, and life in general.
There is a palpable love of learning at Tehiyah.
The teachers we know (some of whom are not Jewish) have a genuine desire to understand and respect each kid for who they are.
The general studies part of the program (which makes up the bulk of the day) gives kids the academic challenges and/or support they need based on their individual requirements.
Jewish traditions are taught and presented as a starting point, not an end point.
Torah stories are discussed with the acknowledgement that some people think they happened exactly as written, while others think they are myths and legends.
