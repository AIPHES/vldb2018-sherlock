A pilot program introducing ethics classes at 10 different NSW public primary schools as an alternative to the current 30 minute weekly religious education classes begins next month.
Rather than being complementary to primary schools' religious education (SRE) classes as promised, ethics classes seem to be in direct competition and in their grab for students, are not restricting enrolment to those who have no religious affiliation and spend the weekly half-hour of religious instruction with supervised study and homework.
"Baulkham Hills Primary and Hurstville Primary, which are taking part in the trial program, have already sent out letters to all parents about classes in ethics, when these should have been limited only to parents who choose not to have their children take part in religious instruction," says Robert Haddad, Director of the Archdiocese of Sydney's Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD).
As Director of the CCD, Robert Haddad oversees, supports and provides resources for the Archdiocese of Sydney's 1834 volunteer catechists, along with religious leaders from a wide spectrum of faiths across NSW, view the introduction of ethics classes not only as direct competition to current SRE classes but as a further restriction of religious freedom in Australia by special interest minorities.
"During the meeting we strongly proposed that the ethics course should at no stage be offered in direct competition with religious education and also asked that if there was to be a dedicated ethics course, that it be developed and taught within the scope of General Religious Education," Robert Haddad reports.
Under the 1990 NSW Education Act, General Religious Education as well as Special Religious Education is mandated as part of the weekly public school curriculum.
Special Religious Education or SRE, as mentioned in the Act, relates to the teaching of the beliefs and practices of an approved religious faith by its authorised representatives.
These include volunteer catechists from the Sydney Archdiocese as well as those trained by other faiths to give religious instruction in Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism or any other of the world's major religions.
General Religious Education, by contrast, is broader in scope and involves the general study of the world's religions, allowing students to explore these different beliefs and the affect they have on the lives of their adherents.
Parents or caregivers under Section 33 of the Act are entitled to exempt their children from either or both of these classes.
"Claims that ethics courses will stop pupils from 30 minutes each week ï¿½twiddling their thumbs' while their classmates are being given religious education, doesn't stand up.
Worth noting, also, is the fact that if the NSW Government intends to add ethics courses as part of a state-wide syllabus once the trial is over, it will also have to change the law and the current Education Act, which only makes provision for general religious and special religious classes.
