The curriculum has extended to include modern foreign languages.
Swimming instruction is included within the PE syllabus for years five and six only, for which a small charge is requested to offset the expense of the non-statutory area of instruction.
All sports are encouraged as a vital part of our healthy school approach.
Boys and girls take part in football, netball, athletics, rounders, cricket and swimming across the Borough and south-east England.
Religious Worship and Instruction
Religious affiliation: None
Arrangements for religious worship and instruction - Religious Education is provided at the school in accordance with the Bexley London Borough's Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education.
If requested in writing by the parents, a pupil may be excused from attendance at religious worship and/or instruction.
Pastoral Care
Prior to these classes parents are invited to view the materials to be used.
Sometimes this will happen formally, but more often informally without the children realising, such as marking work or in noting children's oral responses to planned questions.
Of course, aunties, uncles, Grandparents, younger and older siblings can all join in the fun!
All pupils are encouraged to take books home and there will be times when they are required to take home reading, spellings, multiplication tables and project research as required by individual teachers.
The cost at this time is Â£3.00 per morning, though of course this may increase in the future.
