In September 2007, the Church of England joined all the other main faith school providers in England in signing a shared vision for promoting community cohesion through schools with a religious character.
In 'Faith in the System,' the Government and religious groups confirmed their commitment to continue to work together - and with schools with and without a religious character - to improve the life chances of children, to build bridges to greater mutual trust and understanding and to contribute to a just and cohesive society.
Many church schools (both VC and VA, primary and secondary) have a high proportion of Muslim children, a substantial number have over 80 per cent intake from the Muslim community.
The CofE is committed to reserving at least 25 per cent of places in new CofE schools for pupils from the local neighbourhood regardless of faith background or none.
In practice most new CofE schools reserve less than 50 per cent for Christian applicants, and almost all CofE Academies have 100 per cent neighbourhood admissions.
A 2008 survey showed that the majority of the population - including those who do not see themselves as Christian - agree that parents should be able to choose a state-run school for their child based on their own religious, moral or philosophical considerations.
Two-thirds of parents (with children under 18) hold this opinion, consistent with the spirit of plurality in education which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.
