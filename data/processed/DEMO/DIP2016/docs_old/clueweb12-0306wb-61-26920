It would be fair to say that most parents and probably a large number of schools have come to accept such a level of parental involvement as the norm.
Parents who set up schools are not likely to do so for the sake of their own children alone.
Although research findings have indicated a reasonable measure of support in Northern Ireland for integrated education, in practice only small numbers of people have been involved in actually founding the schools (Cairns, 1989).
The sizes of the founding groups range from a minimum of six or seven to a maximum of around thirty.
Northern Ireland�s population of one and a half million operates through a closely-knit series of social networks which easily accommodates this kind of interaction.
In many cases the early meetings were held in private homes.
In this way discussions could take place and plans could be formulated undisturbed by attention from the media or the general public.
These periods of �quiet processes� bonded the founders together in a close fellowship of common aims and shared experiences which was to have important implications.
Their position was, and remains, that if parents wish to send their children to maintained or controlled schools then they should be free to do so.
Many parents indicated that they wanted their children to attend a school where they would meet members of the �other� community since they believed that this would help to develop better relationships across the whole community.
This ideological commitment to the improvement of community relations seemed to arise either from strong political and social beliefs or from religious conviction.
There were many deeply committed Roman Catholics and Protestants amongst the parents.
The views they expressed centred on what they perceived to be the unchristian nature of the divisions in Northern Irish society and the need to express their Christian commitment to reconciliation between the two communities.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in particular has indicated that, whilst the education of children is the prime responsibility of the parents, a proper grounding in the faith can only be gained through attendance at a Roman Catholic school.
Although the ideals of these two sub-sets of parents are clearly related, the existence of two rather different ideologies, based on political/social and religious beliefs respectively, appeared to be a possible source of difficulty.
The group with strong religious views were anxious that the schools should provide their children with a clearly Christian education.
They saw the integrated schools as firmly Christian in character and indeed felt that they should be more Christian than the other schools in the province.
Whilst they wanted the integrated schools to welcome children of all faiths and none, they saw this wide community as existing within a Christian framework.
In contrast, some of the parents who had strong social and political views were not sympathetic to a very clear Christian emphasis within the schools.
Some were Christian but others were agnostic or atheist, and they expressed concern that the schools could become too closely identified with Christianity.
In some cases this was related to a view that �there�s too much religion in Ireland anyway�, and in others to a fear that in an overtly Christian school those of other religions or none might not be totally comfortable or feel fully valued.
Almost all the parents interviewed talked about their concern over their children�s educational progress and for most of them the hope that their child would gain educationally had been a factor in the choice of an integrated school.
In other words they were evaluating the school in terms of the quality of education it offered in the same way they would any other school.
In our sample differences can be detected between those sending their children to the primary schools and those sending children to the secondary school, and also between those who had enrolled their child in the first form of the school and those who had moved a child or children from another school to the integrated school.
Most parents are very anxious that their child should gain a place in a grammar school, but places are available for only about 30 per cent of each year group, and are allocated on the results of a competitive testing procedure.
They do not admit pupils on the basis of the 11 + or �transfer procedure� results, but through a combination of personal parental application, report from the primary school and interview.
The schools themselves had tried to avoid this type of comparison, but in a situation where a hierarchy of quality in secondary schools is deeply embedded in the society it is probably inevitable that these new schools should be assigned a place in the hierarchy.
We decided, therefore, that all information would be collected on a personal basis, either through attendance at meetings or through semi-structured personal interviews Dexter, 1970; Seldon, 1983; Moyser, 1987; Haplin, 1990).
Given the problems previously outlined about approaching people and asking them to take part in a study of this sort, picking a random sample and then either writing to individuals to ask for an interview or turning up at their homes to ask them to take part in an interview, did not seem appropriate.
The interviews were based on a semi-structured format to ensured that a range of topics were covered in each interview, though the order in which issued were raised varied depending on the ways interviewees responded.
Almost all interviews with parents were carried out in parents own homes and most frequently during the evening, since this proved more convenient for the respondents and allowed us to interview more working parents.
This again raises questions both for the future development of the schools and for wider issues relating to parental involvement in education.
It must be questionable whether, in situations where a group was not driven by such a clear commitment and such strong underlying beliefs, parents or teachers would be prepared to put in so much time.
Even in the integrated schools some of those who were active at the founding stage indicate that they now feel 'burnt out' and at the same time they are anxious that parents and teachers who are now coming into the schools may not be so ideologically committed and so may not be prepared to invest so much time and energy.
At the same time the very strength of commitment of some of the pioneers of integrated education could itself be problematic.
It is not at all clear what are the long term consequences of a relatively small group of individuals with very strong views having a major input into the policy of a school.
In the integrated schools the contribution of such individuals was crucial in the initial stages but it may now be posing some problems.
The debate over the extent to which the schools should be 'Christian' in their ethos and how this should affect the attitude to the participation of teachers, parents and children of other religious backgrounds or none is related to this and is producing a range of strong opinions.
This clearly echoes some of the debates currently surfacing in Britain about the place of religious education in multi-ethnic schools
Another aspect of the impact of individuals with strong commitments and views is the tension between long term and short term policy making.
Schools as institutions usually have a long life, well in excess of the child-rearing span of any one family, but individual parents have a much shorter period of direct active participation in their family's education.
In a situation where parents have a strong voice in the management of a school, a group of parents with a clear ideology may influence school policy in a particular direction only to be replaced in a relatively short period by another group who may have quite different aspirations for the school.
The integrated schools and official bodies
As was made clear in the first section of this report the integrated schools developed outside the formal religious, political and administrative structures of Northern Ireland.
The churches, the political parties and government agencies did little to help the original groups who campaigned for integrated education and in some cases put obstacles in their way.
Once the first schools had been established the attitude shifted from one which could have been characterised as 'we don't want it, but it won't happen anyway' to one which saw the integrated school movement as unwelcome but too small to have to worry about.
It is hard to object to parents' wish to influence their children's education or to condemn an organisation which has as one of its central aims the desire to improve community relations and end sectarian violence.
This ambivalence is clearly seen in the attitude of the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic church, which on the one hand supports the right of parents to choose the appropriate education for their children but on the other seeks to ensure that all Catholic children are educated in Catholic schools.
Throughout the development of the schools one of the strengths of the movement has been that it has been very difficult to 'tie' the integrated schools to any faction in the community conflict.
A common way of defusing cross community movements and peace initiatives in Northern Ireland has been to try to link them to the political aspirations of one faction and hence to undermine their credibility with other elements in the community and destroy their effectiveness as reconciling agents.
In the case of the integrated school movement to find and exploit any such weakness has been very difficult since they received no help or support from any official groups or organisations on either side of the community - they could not be portrayed as agents of either Unionism, Nationalism or British government policy.
What began as a 'grassroots' movement outside all official structures now has government support.
In many contexts this could simply be interpreted as government policy reflecting the wishes of the governed in the best traditions of democracy.
But in a situation of civil unrest, such as exists in Northern Ireland, it can also be interpreted as government taking over and using an initiative for political ends.
Any official support or recognition carries dangers in Northern Ireland and the integrated school movement will have to come to terms with the delicate task of establishing a relationship with DENI whilst at the same time preserving a high level of visible independence.
The structure of the integrated school 'movement'
During its early phases integrated education developed in a very 'ad hoc' fashion.
Groups of interested parents met in private homes to begin discussing the issues, planning campaigns for change and eventually organising the establishment of schools.
ACT and BELTIE subsequently developed as umbrella organisations to try to co-ordinate the campaign for integrated schooling and exert pressure on government for support, but they have not developed a clear structure and policy nor can they claim to represent all the schools.
Individual schools have continued to be established as a result of the work of local pressure groups and there has been no planned sequence in the opening of schools and no general policy concerning the geographical distribution of schools.
The effective control on the opening of the next school has usually been the availability of finance, in the form of either grants or loans from the major foundations
After almost ten years and with fourteen schools in operation (1992) there is now considerable pressure both from the foundations and the government for the development of a more coherent policy and organisational structure.
The foundations do not wish to continue to be asked to respond to individual local initiatives and government have to try to operate the new legislation in the Education Reform Order relating to integrated schools.
Both would like some central body through which negotiations could be carried on.
NICIE would seem to be the natural organisation to take on this role but this is currently proving problematic for a number of reasons.
One of the things which originally attracted many of the founders to become involved with integrated schools was the 'grassroots' nature of the enterprise and the freedom from a central bureaucracy.
Some of those early pioneers are averse to any suggestion that there is an integrated schools 'movement' for them there are just individual integrated schools which may have no more in common with one another than they have with any other schools in Northern Ireland.
To move to a position where a body such as NICIE could speak on behalf of the schools or negotiate for them would be seen by many parents and teachers as undermining their roles.
At the same time integrated schooling may well now have reached a stage where some thought will have to be given to the development of a medium term strategy for coordinated planning for the opening of new schools and the growth of existing ones.
The future pattern of Integrated schooling
This question of forward planning is clearly linked to the various possible future patterns of and roles for integrated education within the Northern Irish education system.
At present both parents and teachers seem to see the future mainly in terms of the expansion of the school they are connected with, plus a general interest in seeing 'more schools' in other parts of the province.
The wider issues tend to be seen through rather specific concerns.
The teachers see the growth in the number of schools as giving them more flexibility in terms of promotion and career development, whilst the parents are interested in seeing more schools open so that travel will be less of a problem and secondary schooling will be available outside Belfast.
Alternatives to the present process of opening completely new schools also have to be considered in any future planning.
This would raise a whole new set of questions for the parents and teachers involved in the original integrated schools, as they would have to consider their relationship with a set of schools approaching integration with a completely different history and possibly totally different underlying aims and values.
This raises the further question of whether in the long term the main contribution of integrated schools will be through the establishment of a new structure which will run in parallel with the two existing sets of schools or whether the main effect will be through subtly changing the educational climate and the relationships and expectations of both parents and teachers in the controlled and maintained schools.
With this range of possibilities and the current uncertain but relatively open agenda, there is an urgent need for some more detailed analysis of the possible patterns which may emerge over the next 10 or 15 years.
This would have to take into account the demographic and geographical constraints which in a relatively sparsely populated and still predominantly rural community are crucial.
If the integrated schools can develop an effective organisational structure, such an analysis might be one of its priorities but at present there does not seem to be a forum through which such questions can be addressed and this may have damaging consequences in the medium or long term.
This research has tried to examine a social and educational phenomenon which is at a relatively early stage of development and which is changing rapidly.
This means that we can only provide a snapshot of where the integrated schools were at a particular moment.
During the two years of the project there were major changes, the provisions of the Education Reform Order and the introduction of the Common Curriculum altered the framework within which the schools operate, four new schools opened, new parents and teachers became involved with the schools and long established figures moved out.
At the same time in retrospect we believe even more firmly than we did at the outset that it was essential to carry out an investigation at this stage.
To have delayed in the interests of 'letting the situation settle' or 'letting the schools find their feet' would have meant that many of the formative early experiences of both teachers and parents would have been forgotten and lost.
At they same time, although the objectives are still unclear, they are having to try to create mechanisms which will allow them to interact productively without threatening or intimidating one another.
The study had both a specific contextual remit to examine the integrated schools in Northern Ireland and also a wider aim of illuminating the general area of parent-teacher interaction.
As is perhaps inevitable in research of this sort the report raises as many questions as it answers, so the concluding summary also constitutes an agenda for further research.
Liaison between the schools could be assisted if there was a forum which all the schools felt able to use to exchange experiences and co-ordinate future planning.
(b) Moving from primary to secondary school
The primary-secondary interface is a crucial area which is likely to affect the development of integrated education.
As an issue it is only just beginning to surface as it is only now that considerable numbers of children are reaching the end of an integrated primary education and their parents are having to decide where they should go for their secondary education.
Outside Belfast this is a difficult and sometimes distressing experience for parents and children.
weekly boarding or negotiation with existing secondary schools to see whether some of them could make any specific provision for an intake of pupils from an integrated primary background.
If some thought is not given to this transition it could be that anxiety about what is to happen when the child is 11 could be a factor which might deter some parents from using the schools.
From a research perspective it would be very valuable if information could be collected about children leaving integrated primary schools who go into each of the secondary sectors - integrated, catholic, Protestant, grammar, intermediate and comprehensive.
Such an investigation merits a research study in its own right.
(c) The career patterns of teachers
The effect of teaching in an integrated school on the medium and long term career patterns of the teachers also needs to be analysed.
Most of the teachers came from the segregated school sectors into the integrated schools but there is as yet little evidence that moves in the reverse direction will become common.
If in the future teachers do move freely it could have a considerable effect on the whole profession but if the teachers in the integrated schools are isolated they may become frustrated and disillusioned.
Again this is an area which should be monitored over the next few years.
One group of parents for whom the schools have particular importance are those in 'mixed Roman Catholic/Protestant marriages.
When we began this research we knew that there was anecdotal evidence that many parents in mixed marriages were involved with the schools.
As the study progressed the evidence clearly supported this view and it also became apparent what importance these parents attached to the availability of the schools.
People in mixed marriages can feel isolated and vulnerable in a polarised society such as Northern Ireland.
A connection with the schools therefore seems to have a wider significance for this group and would be very valuable if a more detailed study could be made of in this area.
At present there are studies of the demographic aspects of mixed marriages, their incidence, geographical distribution etc. but there is very little information about the social implications.
Our second set of conclusions raises a number of wider questions relating to parent - teacher interaction which we believe have significance for schools through out the United kingdom.
The issues have been analysed in detail in the main sections of the report but to reiterate the central conclusions:-
(a) There are considerable difficulties in sustaining parental involvement after the initial period of innovation.
A new initiative generates enormous enthusiasm and commitment, individuals and groups are prepared to give very large amounts of time and expertise in order to achieve a clearly defined objective such as opening a school by a specific date.
It is less easy to sustain on-going enthusiasm and interest in the running of an on-going institution.
This appears to be true even when there is strong ideological and religious motivation as is the case with the integrated schools in Northern Ireland.
In contexts where the issues are less emotive it may be even more difficult.
Such groups may well be seen by others as wielding power and influence and also as 'closed'.
This perception of exclusiveness seems to be worrying since it may inhibit the process of ensuring that 'new' parents continually come forward to sustain an ongoing but evolving relationship between parents and teachers.
(c) It seems clear that individuals or small groups with strong opinions can exert great influence.
This can significantly affect school policy and have far reaching implications.
The potential effects this could have if particular social, political or religious groups gained control of schools raises fundamental questions about society's views on the formulation and direction of educational policy.
(d) The evolution of structures which allow a range of levels of interaction between and amongst parents and teachers without any group feeling under threat is crucial This covers mechanisms for strengthening individual parent teacher interactions, and provision of contexts in which discussion within the parent group and amongst the staff group can be facilitated as well as strengthened structures for the two groups to exchange views and co-operate.
(e) The general labels 'parental involvement' and 'parent-teacher co-operation' are oversimplified.
Both processes are multi-layered and there is an urgent both to investigate these layers further and also try to support parents and teachers as they try to develop structures to make interaction at all levels more productive.
In these we examine in turn the information we gained from parents, from teachers and about relationships between the two groups.
The final part of the study examines a number of issues which we believe will be crucial to the future development of the integrated schools in Northern Ireland.
Several of these can only be tentatively identified now, and will have to be investigated through further research over the next few years if their significance, both for education in Northern Ireland and also in a wider UK context, is to be fully understood.
it is difficult to trace precisely the origins of the integrated school movement since it began in a rather nebulous and informal way.
From the early days of the �troubles� in the late 1960�s questions had been asked about whether the segregated education system contributed in any way to community division.
This was a period when simple solutions could still be postulated and there were those who suggested that if children from the two communities went to school together they would be less likely to shoot one another when they grew up.
Against this it was argued that the conflict was rooted in religious, economic, social and political divisions and that education was a manifestation of division rather than a cause (Whyte, 1983; Dunn 1986b).
During the early 1970�s there were a number of more systematic analyses of the potential social impact of education in a divided society.
Funded school-based projects were established which looked at ways in which children from the two communities could be encouraged to think about their differences.
These included the Schools Cultural Studies Project and the Religion in Ireland Project which were curriculum projects, strongly affected by reconstructionist models of education and the ideas of John Dewey.
These were particularly influenced by Malcolm Skilbeck, who was at the time Professor of Education in the New University of Ulster and who for a short period had a considerable impact on educational thinking in Northern Ireland (Robinson, 1987).
At the same time a number of psychologically based studies which had more indirect educational implications were carried out.
In some of these the attitudes of young people from the two communities were analysed and in others the impact of violence on children was assessed (Harbison, 1980; Cairns, 1987).
At a slightly later date more empirical data, relating to the actual levels of interaction between schools across the community divide, were collected and analysed in a series of studies based in the Centre for the Study of Conflict (Darby, 1977; Dunn, 1989a; Dunn & MulIan, 1984; Dunn & Smith, 1989; Smith & Dunn, 1990).
It is difficult to assess the practical impact of these academic studies but they did provide a background against which debate about the role of education began to be more widespread.
Out of this growing general awareness informal pressure began to be exerted by groups of parents who felt instinctively that separation must be damaging to their children.
Much of the initial work was done by individuals and very small groups meeting informally in private houses and the contribution of a few very committed people was crucial.
Many of these individuals and informal groups came together in 1974 when the All Children Together Movement (ACT) was founded.
This was a pressure group which initially sought to lobby for change in the existing school system.
They hoped to persuade parents, the churches and political leaders that the segregated school system was contributing to poor community relations.
They felt that some existing schools could be persuaded to change themselves into integrated schools, and used as evidence to support this belief the series of opinion polls which indicated that there was a considerable body of opinion in Northern Ireland in favour of some form of integration.
In the event, however, it proved very difficult to persuade any existing schools to even consider converting to integrated status.
The churches were firmly opposed, even those who had made some tentative noises about integration, and there were legal problems (Dunn, et al 1989c).
The mid-seventies were not an auspicious period for initiatives in community relations.
The level of violence was high, direct rule from Westminster had been imposed, the attempt at a power-sharing executive, established in the wake of the Sunningdale Agreement, had collapsed after the Ulster Worker�s Council Strike.
The communities appeared to be becoming more polarised, and the hopes of success for any pressure group, especially one interested in a structural change as profound as modifying the basis of the education system, looked very slight.
It is probably true to suggest that at this stage most people involved in education felt that ACT was unlikely to make much progress and would probably not survive long.
It seemed like another �gesture movement which would attract publicity for a time and then, as it failed to achieve anything tangible, would fade away (Darby, 1976).
But some of the founder members of ACT were much more persistent than anyone in the churches, the political parties or the civil service could have envisaged.
By the late 1970�s, when it became clear that no existing schools were likely to try to become integrated, ACT decided to establish such a school itself.
Over a period of several years they set about raising money, negotiating the complexities of planning and safety regulations, finding temporary premises, employing staff and meeting the requirements of education legislation.
In September 1981, Lagan College was opened to a blaze of publicity.
Lagan was followed by a primary school in south Belfast, Forge Primary and by two schools in the north of the city, Hazelwood College (secondary) and Hazelwood Primary.
Whilst ACT favoured a gradual expansion of integrated schools and was anxious that Lagan and Forge should become firmly established and prove their viability before other schools opened, BELTIE supported a faster expansion policy, feeling that the integrated schools needed to make a rapid impact in as many areas of Northern Ireland as possible.
In the event the opening of schools has gone on at a rate which is probably intermediate between the ambitions of ACT and BELT IE.
Outside Belfast all the schools have been at the primary level and they have developed out of local initiatives with little central planning and often tenuous, or even non-existent, organisational links with either ACT or BELTIE.
This development history has raised a number of issues about the structure of the integrated school movement itself and its interactions with other organisations.
A few of those closely connected with some individual schools favour a high level of autonomy for each school and resist the idea that there is an integrated school �movement� at all.
Others are anxious that there should be a coherent structure through which the schools can negotiate as a group with government departments, founding bodies and the churches.
Supporters of this view have been instrumental in establishing NICIE (the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education) but there are still some problems and not all the schools are linked to NICIE (Dunn, 1989c).
Although the structure of education in Northern Ireland is complex, with controlled, maintained and voluntary schools, a set of relationships between the Department of Education, the local Education and Library Boards, the churches and the teaching unions have been established over the years, and these work relatively smoothly.
The integrated schools had no such established relationships and have had to try to negotiate their position with each of these groups, and also with the major charitable trusts who have played a vital role in providing initial funding.
Each school has been established by a group of parents and their local supporters.
This group has had to set up what is essentially a private or independent school.
The finance for buildings, salaries and running costs has had to be raised form a combination of local efforts, major grants and interest free loans from large charitable foundations (such as the Nuffield Foundation and the Rowntree Charitable Trust).
Only when a school is established and has proved its �viability�, as evidenced by a sizable enrolment and evidence of preschool children on a waiting list, can negotiations about taking the school into the state system begin.
In each case to date, protracted individual negotiations have been necessary, and the schools have had to support themselves for several years until these negotiations are successfully completed.
When DENI accepts a school into the system the school buildings are purchased from the local group by DENI and the school is eligible for payment of 100% of its running costs (salaries, maintenance, consumables) and 85% of capital costs (new buildings and major equipment).
Several of the school support services such as routine maintenance, advisory support, individual music tuition and the library service are provided by the Education and Library Boards and the integrated schools have had to negotiate with the relevant Board for their areas about the provision of these services.
The responses of the Boards have varied and whilst some have been supportive others have been less helpful.
The churches and the political parties have in general been reluctant to become involved at all.
Any support has been tacit rather than overt and there has been some direct criticism of the schools.
For example, the Roman Catholic church has made public its support for its own church schools and has raised questions about the religious education and preparation for the sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation provided in the integrated schools.
From a quite different quarter there have also been indirect attacks from fundamentalist Protestant clergy, pointing to the dangers of ecumenism posed by the schools.
In addition the teaching unions have a adopted a rather equivocal position; they have expressed general support for the concept of integrated education but have raised questions about the need for schools in specific locations and have also raised the issue of the threat to teaching posts in existing schools posed by the opening of a new school in a town.
Overall the integrated schools have had considerable difficulties as they have tried to establish a position within the education structure of Northern Ireland and in many areas these difficulties are not yet resolved (McGaffin, 1987).
The Education Reform Order (the equivalent of the Education Reform Act in England and Wales) came into effect after this research began, but some of the Orders provisions are likely to have a major effect on the development of integrated schools (HMSO, 1989).
The Minister of Education has indicated that he wishes to support the establishment of integrated schools �where this is the wish of parents�.
This support will take the form of measures to make the initial funding of the schools easier, 100% funding for capital projects and priority in the allocation of capital funds.
It is too early to say yet whether these moves will have a major effect on the spread of integrated education.
What is clear, however, is that any attempt to change existing structures within the fragile political context of Northern Ireland is problematic.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy have challenged, in the High Court, the provisions in the Reform order for the financial support of integrated schools and although this has failed in law, feelings of grievance remain.
Some supporters of integrated education themselves have misgivings about the increase in government support, on the grounds that a considerable part of the movement�s early success was related to its obvious independence and separateness from any organisations which could be identified with either side of the community.
There are fears that closer links with DENI could be interpreted as a lessening of this independence.
It will already be clear from the previous section that many of the issues surrounding the establishment and current operation of the integrated schools are extremely complicated and potentially sensitive in political terms.
Research which seeks to investigate such areas, in a community as deeply and dangerously divided as Northern Ireland, faces difficulties which inevitably affect the choice of methodology.
The research sought to examine how individual parents and teachers became connected with the schools, what they have actually done, how it has affected their lives and relationships and how they hope integrated schooling will develop.
Answers to questions of this sort involve disclosing personal views and commitments, and in the Northern Ireland context, this can be threatening both for the researcher and the subject of the research.
At primary level the choice available to parents is less constrained, at least in theory.
A child can be enrolled in any controlled primary school of the parents choice, similarly parents can apply to have a child enrolled in any maintained primary school.
The only restrictions relate to the provision of free transport, the relevant regulation states that the cost of transport will be paid to the nearest suitable� school, and this is interpreted to take account of the existence of the two separate school systems and the right of parents to exercise a choice on grounds of religious denomination.
The religious divide is very rarely crossed and almost all children attend the neighbourhood primary school appropriate to their own community, which will be �controlled� if they are Protestant and �maintained� if they are Roman Catholic.
Some parents did suggest that they chose an integrated school because they felt it would place less emphasis on preparation for the 11 + than other primary schools, whilst others seemed to be motivated mainly by dissatisfaction with a school of which they had direct experience and this had precipitated a move.
One significant factor, however, is the availability of nursery units linked to most of the integrated schools.
Nursery provision is very limited in Northern Ireland, and so the availability of nursery places in the units attached to the integrated schools has proved very attractive to parents.
In theory there is no reason why a child should not attend the nursery class of an integrated school and then transfer to the local controlled or maintained primary school�s reception class.
But in fact almost all the children do go directly from the nursery to the reception class.
This nursery provision in the primary schools may, like the comprehensive status of the secondary schools, have the effect of bringing a group of parents, who do not have an initial ideological commitment, into the integrated school movement.
It is interesting that whilst some of the founding parents would see this widening of the base for integrated education as desirable others would express anxiety about possible dilution of the ideals of integration.
There are very few nursery units in Northern Ireland and government funding for education of under four year olds has been limited.
As a result very few controlled or maintained primary schools have been able to develop any nursery provision.
It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the development of units attached to the integrated primary schools has generated considerable hostility amongst other members of the teaching profession.
Interviews with a group of principals of controlled and maintained primary school indicated that, although they accept that the integrated schools have to fund the nurseries themselves, they believe that their very existence represents �unfair competition�.
(c) Dissatisfaction with existing schools
In addition to the parents who sent their child to an integrated school at the beginning of nursery, primary or secondary education, there were also a number of parents who moved their child to an integrated school part-way through a phase of education.
their child out of an existing controlled or maintained school as soon as the integrated school opened.
This set included most of the founding parents with children of appropriate age.
But there were also parents not so closely linked to the founding of the schools who were in some way dissatisfied with the existing system and saw the integrated school as a way out of their problem.
Some parents had moved because they felt a general dissatisfaction with the existing schools; amongst the views expressed were that the schools in Northern Ireland were too formal, that they did not provide an education with enough emphasis on the child, and that because of this formality it was difficult for parents to talk to teachers or to discuss their concerns.
These were fairly generalised reasons for changing school but there were also parents who were more specific.
Some children had been transferred into the integrated school because of a perceived lack of educational progress or because of emotional or behavioural difficulties.
In some of these cases children were moved at a fairly late stage of primary education because of a history of difficulty, sometimes in the form of learning or behavioural problems.
Such children had often already been moved between schools at least once before and they usually transferred into the upper classes (P5, 6 or 7) of the integrated schools.
This type of move was most common during the first years after a school opened, when numbers were small in the upper forms and there was some pressure to take pupils.
The results were predictably varied, in some cases parents were satisfied that the child did benefit, in others they were disappointed and felt there was little �improvement�.
There was also some anxiety from other parents and from teachers that too many potentially disruptive children might come
into the schools and create additional difficulties at a time when just getting started was already a hard task.
(d) Convenience
It may seem surprising in discussing a movement which has involved such a level of commitment and controversy, to find that for some parents the choice of an integrated school was a matter of convenience.
However, quite a number of those interviewed did indicate that they sent their child to the school because it was the nearest school, or was easy to reach on their way to work.
It is interesting that proximity and convenience were mentioned quite frequently by parents in a strongly Protestant working-class area close to one of the primary schools.
Many of these parents came from relatively �hard-line� working class Protestant backgrounds, and they did not see their child�s attendance at an integrated school as conflicting with their loyalist political views or as threatening their children�s identity.
(e) Mixed Marriages
One particular group for whom the establishment of the integrated schools appears to have presented a particularly welcome new choice is parents in �mixed marriages�.
In Northern Ireland �mixed marriage� does not mean a marriage across racial divisions but one between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant.
Society�s reaction to such marriages is very variable but they are often the source of considerable conflict and bitterness within families.
In some cases one or both partners may be estranged from their family for a period, and in extreme cases permanently.
One �mixed marriage� parent offered the succinct comment, �where mixed marriages are concerned, they often seem more important to other people than to those involved�.
The proportion of mixed marriages varies considerably in different parts of Northern Ireland.
In some areas they are very uncommon, while in others between twelve and fifteen percent of marriages involve partners from the two communities.
One of the case study schools is in an area where the proportion is over ten per cent.
Our interviews included a considerable number of parents involved in mixed marriages and it became clear that the integrated schools presented a particularly important choice for them, since religious upbringing and choice of school are so closely linked.
Interviewees indicated that the question of the education of children was usually discussed at the outset of the marriage, long before children were born, and then again with much more immediacy once children were born and began to approach school age.
Existing evidence suggests that children of mixed marriages are frequently brought up in the religion of the mother, and attend the appropriate school, and that this is particularly so when the mother is a Roman Catholic (Compton, 1989).
In addition grandparents seem to exert considerable pressure over their grandchildren�s religious upbringing and education.
The parents interviewed in our study suggested that the existence of an integrated school prevented considerable friction both between the parents and in the wider family circle.
In some cases parents said that once they had chosen an integrated school they felt a great sense of relief.
Some felt it was other members of the family who �bothered� most about the children�s education and the choice of an integrated school helped to placate them.
One Roman Catholic mother recalled that her mother was not pleased that she did not choose a maintained school but was better pleased than she would have been if a controlled school had been chosen.
Where there is no such compromise available the choice of school can create the perception that either the father or the mother has had to �give up� something.
In a wider sense the integrated school also helps to validate the mixed marriage itself by providing a context in which cross community contact is celebrated and parents are able to mix with other people who either share their experience or are sympathetic to it.
This provides a form of support difficult to obtain elsewhere.
However, once the choice is made, there are still problems to be solved.
Religious education in the integrated schools is provided partially through a common curriculum which seeks to emphasise shared Christian values.
But separate religious teaching is also provided, particularly in the primary schools where provision is made for specific requirements, such as preparing children for the sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation in the Roman Catholic church.
Parents then decide whether or not their children are to receive this additional denominational teaching; for parents in a mixed marriage this could still be contentious as it would to some extent �identify� the children with one or other denomination.
In fact the interviews suggest that the system works quite well, perhaps because there has not been the need for a clear cut choice of a denominational school, and so specific issues about doctrine seemed less threatening.
However, the need to provide very specific teaching to meet the requirements of the Roman Catholic church, when there is no clear parallel requirement from the Protestant churches, has lead some people to suggest that the Roman Catholic church is still exerting great power even in the integrated schools.
How they think attendance at an integrated school affects their children?
We were interested in what the parents wanted from the integrated school and whether their expectations were being met.
The decision to send a child to an Integrated School is clearly not the end of the parent�s concern.
Once the child is enrolled the focus shifts to the experience itself, and how it is affecting the child.
We therefore asked a number of questions about these issues.
In general the parents expressed the normal range of views and concerns of any parent about the formal educational progress of their children.
Most parents said that they were generally happy with the way the curriculum subjects were being presented, though there were specific points about the progress of individual children in particular subjects or classes.
Some parents commented that their child had made much better progress since being moved to an integrated school, while a few expressed disappointment that there had not been the hoped for improvements.
Our research focus meant that we were particularly interested in how parents felt the schools were affecting their children�s social development.
When questions were asked about the children�s social development, and more specifically about effects on their responses to the �other� community, parents were perhaps understandably vague.
The questions seemed to give them the opportunity to articulate their own aspirations for the schools rather than to describe the effects on their children.
The word which kept cropping up was �awareness�; the parents seemed especially anxious that their children should �know� about the other community, its traditions, religious beliefs and so on.
There was a sense of regret that they had not had the opportunity to mix or be �aware� during their own childhood and that they now saw this as a loss which their children might be able to avoid.
Precisely how this was to be achieved and how it would be possible to detect whether or not it was being achieved, they, in common with everyone else, found difficult to evaluate.
One parent believed that his son was already more tolerant than his father and added that he hoped his son �would go further than he had towards the other community�.
On a rather wider scale parents quite often indicated that they hoped the schools would be part of a long term solution to the �troubles� in Northern Ireland.
They did not see the schools as a simple direct solution but as a more subtle indirect influence.
Comments such as �they will be seen to work�, �they are an example of what is possible� and �they make people think�, catch the flavour of the views expressed.
There was also a feeling that it was very important that �staunch� Protestants and Roman Catholics were choosing to send their children to the schools.
One parent was pleased that there was already a measure of attendance from �hard� areas which indicated �a hopeful break in attitude.
The ice has been broken.
Another issue was whether the schools should directly teach content which would contribute to improved community relations through the formal curriculum or whether such objectives would be better achieved through the hidden or para curriculum.
The responses suggest that, whilst they were quite happy that their children should study topics which would help them to understand both sides of Northern Ireland�s cultural, literary and historical background, they felt that the actual presence of the pupils and teachers from the two communities in the one institution was the crucial factor.
The importance of integration was usually stressed but there was also the hope that the schools would be more �child-centred� than most of the other schools in the province.
This may seem a slightly outdated phrase in to-day�s educational world, but there is clearly a strand within the integrated school movement which sees changes, towards a more �liberal�, child-centred model, as one of the prime objectives of the establishment of new schools.
Some parents place emphasis on one and some on the other, but most see both objectives as being furthered partially through the overt curriculum and partially through the hidden curriculum.
In a complex situation many features of the schools appear to serve different purposes for different parents, but the resulting contradictions currently seem to be causing little difficulty.
Certainly, the consensus of opinion amongst those interviewed was that their children were �happy� at their integrated schools.
Overall the parents seemed proud of their association with integrated schools.
This is expressed openly as a sense of achievement, one parent said she was pleased �to have stuck it out� and to �have followed it through�.
Some parents said they talked about the school to others and always praised it.
(Although in contrast one parent said that, although she was happy with the school, she did not have the right to try to influence the judgment of others).
Many parents felt that they had undergone some form of personal development as a result of their association with the integrated school.
I learned about education and in particular about how the school was working�.
Although, of course this was not universal and some argued that they had not been affected so much.
A number claimed that as they were �liberal� before they became involved with the schools they did not experience a major change in attitude.
Parental involvement, how parents are involved with the schools
In conventional terms parental involvement has been taken to mean parents and teachers working in a close partnership for the benefit of the child (Blackstone, 1979; Beattie, 1985; Docking, 1990).
In the context of integrated education the phrase �parental involvement� has come to have new meaning because the schools have been set up by parents.
They do not owe their existence to the local Education and Library Boards or to the Department of Education for Northern Ireland or to any of the churches.
They are there because parents wanted them to be there, because parents were willing to undertake the task of creating schools which would provide the kind of education they wanted for their children.
For founder parents, parental involvement predates and parallels the life of the school.
It is both fundamental and developmental.
The relationship of the founder parent to the school sometimes seemed almost like that of the parent to the child, an emotional attachment with all the attendant responsibilities, fears, tensions, and of course joys.
Again, parents involved at the next level have a different kind of relationship with the school.
This kind of involvement seemed to hold little appeal for most parents because it was perceived as the domain of the professional person, who could presumably cope with areas like institutional finance which were perceived as being beyond the competence of the �ordinary� parent.
This is an interesting perception, particularly in terms of LMS, of parent governors and the national curriculum.
We specifically asked parents if there were issues relating to integrated education which were causing them concern.
Perhaps because of this lack of hard evidence about the comparative standing of the schools some parents were sensitive to details which they felt might indicate something about discipline or standards.
For the parents with children reaching the end of primary education there was a real dilemma.
In some areas there are secondary schools with a tradition of taking a small number of pupils across the community divide and parents saw these as schools which might be sympathetic to children from an integrated primary school.
This was not seen as a problem since parents felt that pupils would be old enough to handle any problems that might arise, and also that the schools they would be going to would not be very sectarian, especially at sixth form level.
The other central group in this research was teachers and a series of personal interviews was carried out, essentially similar to those conducted with parents.
So, as with the parents, there was a feeling from the teachers that the schools offered individuals the opportunity to give tangible expression to their desire for improved community relations.
It is clear that some parents, when they were considering sending their children to an integrated school, were impressed by this, as one said, �Teachers were making a major commitment.
(b) Religious Commitment
With regard to religious commitments, the views expressed by the teachers are closely related to those of the parents.
It was often difficult to separate religious and ideological motives.
Many of the teachers expressed their strong religious faith and said that it was this that had made them anxious to teach in an integrated school.
Like some of the parents they felt that the separation of children was alien to the spirit of Christianity.
In several cases the expression of these views had led then into argument with the clergy of their own church and this had clearly been distressing for them.
For some this meant that they were experiencing a stressful conflict between their loyalty to their church and their deeply held personal religious views.
In other cases the views of clergy had led them to distance themselves from formal religious structures and to rely on their own interpretation of Christian values.
One teacher, who expressed her views in this area particularly clearly, summed up many of the main points raised.
Although she taught Religious Education within the school she felt that religion should be the concern of the family and should not determine the choice of school.
She based her views directly on her experience of teaching in both maintained and controlled sectors.
Neither of these had suited her: she found the maintained schools �narrow-minded� and talked about the �catholic twilight syndrome�.
In controlled schools, on the other hand, she felt �constrained� and was not �free�.
For instance she was very aware that minor features of her speech, such as the way she pronounced the sound �h�, immediately revealed her ethnic identity.
Constrained was a term she used frequently about both types of schools.
By moving to an integrated school she hoped that she �could be herself�.
Many of the teachers cited educational considerations as a reason for their move into integrated education.
They saw in the schools the possibility of working in an environment with a different educational ethos.
A number recalled how, at the interview for a post in the school, they felt it necessary to convince the panel that, if appointed, they would be able to fit in with regard to child-centred education, a different approach to discipline and so on.
The main point was that the existing schools were very formal and hierarchical and that the integrated schools seemed to hold out the possibility of a more relaxed and �caring� educational environment.
The desire for a more �child-centred� education voiced by some of the parents was also echoed by teachers.
Dislike of single-sex schools, and unhappiness about the eleven plus selection procedure, were also mentioned, especially by the secondary school teachers.
A new school offers the chance to try out ideas, and this had also attracted some of the senior members of staff in particular.
The newness, the rhetoric of participation and the challenge of making integrated education work, were all mentioned as factors which had attracted them.
Amongst the principals there were individuals with clearly developed educational philosophies and they felt that they were now able, for the first time, to try to put these into practice.
The centrality of �valuing� the child, and giving each individual a sense of his or her own worth, were at the core of the philosophy of one of the principals.
This approach was being closely linked to integration through the concept that only pupils who were confident of their own value could in turn value and respect others, especially others who differed from them in religion, culture or political aspirations.
In addition to the motives related to social, political, religious and educational values, the teachers also expressed strictly practical reasons for their move to a post in an integrated school.
For some of the teachers their post in an integrated school was their first teaching post since qualifying, or their first permanent post.
For them the priority had been to get a permanent job and they had taken the first such post offered.
This does not imply that they were not interested in the philosophy of integration but they had had to adopt a pragmatic approach to getting a job, especially since there is a surplus of newly qualified primary teachers in Northern Ireland.
Although generalisations are dangerous, there was some evidence that the main difference between teachers� motives for working in integrated schools were related to their age and career stage.
The oldest group mentioned their commitment to the ideals of integrated education most frequently.
It was as if they had consciously decided that, in the final stages of their teaching career, they wished to make a concrete gesture in reaction to the �troubles�.
In a few cases older teachers had moved from more senior to less senior posts, a direct underlining of the strength of their commitment to integrated education.
Amongst the mid-career teachers there was also a strong sense of commitment, but the need for promotion had also been important in their calculations.
The youngest teachers had not always been too conscious of the special nature of the integrated schools when they applied for their posts.
Their priority had been to get a job and their commitment to integrated education had developed as they worked in the school and became more clearly aware of its aims.
The experience of teaching in an integrated school
We were anxious to find out what the experience of teaching in an integrated school was like for teachers.
The majority had previously worked in one of the two segregated sectors in Northern Ireland so they had a direct basis for comparison.
We wished to know whether working in an integrated school was actually different.
The answer, as might be expected, was �partly yes and partly no�.
Many of the basic features of a teacher�s life remained constant.
The planning and presentation of lessons, marking work, preparation for examinations, handling classroom discipline and the day-to-day management of the school went on much as in any other school.
But there were differences.
One teacher commented, �teaching in many respects goes on as usual, but the major differences relate to what integrated education tries to do.
It permeates all attitudes - to parents, the curriculum, even inter-staff relations�.
Linked to this perception, some teachers felt they were more aware of the things they said in the classroom; the fact that children from both communities were in the room made them very sensitive about their choice of words.
They found they had to rethink words and phrases which they had previously taken for granted but which they now saw as having possible sectarian overtones.
This seemed to affect the secondary school teachers particularly, and in subjects such as history, literature and religious education the teachers were aware of some changes in their classroom presentation.
It was also obvious that Religious Education did present particular problems for the primary schools where few teachers were specialists.
There was concern about the question of �balance�, how to construct a syllabus which would reflect equally the traditions of the two major faiths.
Teachers themselves often did not know a great deal about the religious beliefs and practices of the �other� community.
One Catholic teacher worried that she was not achieving a balance because it was difficult for her to come to terms with what she referred to as the �less tangible nature of Protestantism�.
The teachers themselves have, therefore, to become part of the wider learning process.
There was evidence that teachers were concerned about the meaning of integrated education, that they were indeed, �conscious of the need to be different�, and worried if they perceived that they were not.
Just like the founder parents, teachers realised that integrated education was an ongoing business which needed �continual working at�.
One experienced teacher who referred to the school as her �fifth child�, argued that one hundred percent commitment was needed because �the ethos has to be worked at harder.
As the school has grown there are more parents, more children and more teachers, so the school has to be �sold� to them�.
There was much comment about the structural and organisational aspects of the schools and it was here that the teachers were most aware of contrasts.
Almost without exception the teachers talked about the time commitments demanded by working in an integrated schools.
Since teachers in all schools are currently expressing anxiety about the time needed to handle the demands of the National Curriculum and management changes such as LMS, the work that has had to be done in the integrated schools provides concrete evidence and experience of the effects of such change.
A distinction must be made between the initial stages of each school�s life and what might be described as the �ongoing� situation.
All the teachers who had experienced or were experiencing the first year of a school�s operation were overwhelmed by the time demands made during that year.
They had to organise the curriculum, especially with reference to such potentially sensitive areas as religious education, set up management structures to carry through the objective of close parental involvement and handle the immediate practical problems of buildings, furniture and resources.
There were almost daily meetings at lunch time, after school and in the evenings during the first year.
Not only were these an erosion of preparation and relaxation time, they also made new and unfamiliar demands in terms of the skills the teachers had to develop.
Since all the schools have been independent during their first year or two of operation, each has been through a period where they have had to handle their management and finance alone.
Negotiations have been necessary with the Department of Education for Northern Ireland, the local Education and Library Boards, planning authorities, architects, builders, suppliers and charitable trusts.
In relation to all these areas teachers have been asked to exercise new skills for which they have no formal training.
After the early phase, when structures have been established and some of the financial worries have eased there is a degree of let-up, but the management patterns of the integrated schools and the specific objective of close parent-teacher co-operation mean that there is still a heavy commitment to meetings.
The teachers described the experience of so many meetings as interesting and largely productive, but also as very tiring and potentially stressful.
Principals in particular are being placed under severe stress.
In the primary schools they have the added problem of a full teaching load since the schools are currently too small to qualify for a non-teaching principal.
At present the teachers are carrying these burdens out of enthusiasm and commitment but the question must be raised as to whether this is feasible or desirable in the long term.
Also debatable is whether such a level of involvement could be achieved in schools which did not have such a strong underlying ideology and such a distinctive social context.
Teachers also raised specifically the problems created by the need to maintain a religious balance in staffing.
(This also affects the question of promotion which is dealt with later.)
The schools have a stated policy of trying to retain a numerical balance between the two communities in pupils, teaching staff, ancillary staff and governing bodies.
Teachers suggested that this can produce artificial structures and place constraints on the choice of staff, especially when the school is relatively small and the balance can hinge on one appointment.
This was particularly the case in the primary schools where there seems to be a convention that if the principal is from one community the vice-principal should, if at all possible, be a member of the other.
Teachers expressed personal anxiety about this since it could mean that non academic criteria would affect advancement, but at the same time they were conscious of the need to be seen to be maintaining balance.
They felt that it was especially important that the community outside the schools should see them as �fair� and not as tilting towards one group or the other.
They seemed to be suggesting that, at this stage in the development of integrated education, the image of the school in the community was of such importance that some anomalies and contradictions within a school had to be carried to avoid any possible comments about religious bias from outside.
Whether this will remain an issue in the long term, or whether (if the schools can establish their cross-community credentials firmly), precise head counts will no longer be necessary, remains to be seen.
In the course of discussing how and why they had come to teach in an integrated school many teachers also talked about how this choice might affect their future.
They expressed feelings of isolation from other teachers and a sense that they were a small separate, perhaps vulnerable, group.
They believed that going to work in an integrated school was interpreted as �betrayal� by many other teachers in both the controlled and maintained sectors, and as a result they would not be �allowed back�.
Their most frequently used phrase was that they had �burned their boats�.
This may seem rather melodramatic, and there has certainly not yet been sufficient time for it to be tested, but within the traditionally polarised educational world of Northern Ireland it would be surprising if there was not some antagonism to those who overturn established structures.
Because this issue was frequently raised and clearly reflected considerable anxiety, we decided to try to gain some impression of the feelings of teachers outside the integrated schools.
This had not been part of the original research design and so a major investigation was not possible within the tight timetable of the project.
As a small scale case study we selected the area surrounding one of the integrated primary schools and arranged interviews with the principals of the nine other primary schools which serve the community.
The principals agreed to take part in a semi structured personal interview in which they were asked to comment on the general growth of integrated education and, more specifically, on the establishment of an integrated school in their community.
From these interviews it became clear that there was hostility both to the general idea of integrated schools and to the establishment of an actual school in the area.
Integrated education was also thought to be �divisive� since it suggested that existing community relations in the area were not �good enough� and that the established schools did not co-operate with each other.
The argument, therefore, was that the establishment of an integrated school, far from contributing to cross-community contact, could damage it.
In addition there was particular resentment about the provisions of the 1989 Education Reform Order relating to integrated education and in particular to the funding of capital building projects to provide suitable facilities for integrated schools.
These were interpreted as giving the integrated schools priority over other schools and hence an �unfair� advantage in terms of capital funding.
The fact that the government was now showing interest in integrated education and taking the schools into account in formulating policy also gave rise to suspicion and the suggestion that the schools could be �used� as an agent of social policy.
There was also misunderstanding and confusion about the level and form of public funding the schools receive, with a number of principals under the (erroneous) impression that minibus services provided to collect pupils for the integrated schools and the nursery units attached to many of them were paid for by DENI.
The response to the actual existence of an integrated school in the area was one of deliberate non-involvement.
Only one of the principals had visited the new school, although most had been invited to special events such as the official opening: nor did they normally invite the principal or staff of the integrated school to functions held in their schools.
There was an informal principals� group, made up of the principals from the larger controlled and maintained primary schools in the area, which met on a fairly regular basis to discuss current educational policy and development.
However, the principal of the integrated school was not invited to these meetings.
In such a climate the anxieties of the staff in the integrated schools about their careers seem to have some foundation.
The controlled and maintained schools already form two distinct sectors with almost no staff interchange.
There is a little cross community movement of teachers in the voluntary grammar schools, some Protestants work in Catholic grammar schools and vice versa, but the actual numbers are small.
It would appear that, if the situation does not change over the next few years, the teachers in the integrated schools could become another separate sector.
For the teachers there will be the additional problem that, if the schools remain relatively few and geographically scattered, it will be difficult to establish a clear career structure.
During the early phases of the development of the schools there were immediate worries for many of the teachers.
The financial position of some of the schools had been very precarious on numerous occasions and the teachers suggested that there had been times when they wondered whether they would have a job next month or whether there would be a pay cheque at the end of the month.
In retrospect they were philosophical and even amusing about the anxieties they had experienced, but it was very clear that the levels of stress which had been endured were very great and that even now the teachers feel less secure than those in other schools.
The issue of employment outside the integrated schools touched on in the section on career structures was an obvious area of anxiety for the teachers although the extent of their worry varied.
Many seemed relatively resigned to the situation , �I know I�m never going anywhere in career terms now�.
The older teachers were probably least worried, and took the view that they had gone as far as they were going to go in career terms anyway, and so could afford the prospect of having to �stay put� for the remainder of their time in teaching.
They had taken a conscious decision to move to an integrated school, but did not feel they would have to pay too high a price for their gesture.
The teachers in mid-career were aware that they had put themselves in a much more vulnerable position.
Even those who had gained promotion in coming to the integrated school felt that it was quite likely to be the last promotion they would ever have unless the integrated sector grew dramatically over the next few years or unless they were prepared to move outside Northern Ireland.
They did not foresee very rapid growth in the number of schools and the sheer economic and social problems of leaving Northern Ireland deterred most from considering that option.
The young teachers at the start of their careers had initially not given a great deal of thought to their long term future.
They were pleased to have a job in what they felt to be a friendly environment and were immersed in the immediate problems of �finding their feet�.
Some of them were, however, beginning to think about what it meant to be labelled as a �teacher in an integrated school�.
Their main hope was that with a long career stretching in front of them they would see major changes in the educational system in Northern Ireland, although they were not clear what form such changes might take.
The isolation of integrated schools
Some of the teachers talked about links with other schools.
Their interest probably arose from the concerns already discussed about career patterns and the security which work in an integrated school could offer.
The issue they were interested in analysing was, whether the integrated schools should remain separate from the rest of the school system or whether there should be more efforts to establish contacts and interchanges.
Some of the teachers were worried that the schools could become �exclusive� and just another separate group which would add to the divisions in the education system rather than reducing them.
This was often in quite practical terms, such as beginning to understand religious and social conventions which they had previously found strange or threatening.
They also praised the opportunity for professional development which integrated education could provide �there are so many responsibilities to be undertaken .... teachers are constantly reassessing their work in the light of their aims ... all of this ought to stand someone in good stead in interviews in other schools�.
This led some to the view that the contribution they might make to the overall school system in Northern Ireland would be more valuable if they did move back into the controlled or maintained sectors where they could share this learning.
Few, however, believed that this would be possible �in real terms�.
In any case as some pointed out, it was unlikely that they would want to teach in any other kind of school after this experience.
A primary teacher who had previously worked in both sectors said that for her part such a move would �...require major re-thinking.
Previous sections have dealt with the views and concerns of both parents and teachers separately, but central to the original objectives of those who founded the integrated schools was the relationship between the two.
Partnership between parents and teachers is mentioned frequently in the literature of ACT, BELTIE and NICIE.
So, from the outset, one of the main aims was to establish a quite different pattern of relations between parents and teachers and the early history of the schools has reinforced this distinct pattern.
To an extent quite unfamiliar in most educational settings the schools have been �parent driven�.
Individual parents initiated the original meetings at which the idea of integrated education was discussed; in each locality groups of parents met in private houses and then set up the public meetings to gauge community support.
The Parents� Council was established as the main forum where parents could meet on a regular basis to discuss any aspect of the running of the school.
So from the outset parents have been involved in a range of aspects of education with which they would not normally have any contact.
They had to find suitable buildings for a school, negotiate all the details of purchasing, finance and renovation and oversee all stages of preparation up to painting the walls and arranging the desks.
It was often only at quite a late stage, perhaps only two or three months before the school opened, that the first teacher was appointed.
This was usually the principal and he or she was appointed by a panel on which parents formed the majority.
The principal and teachers during the first year or two of each school�s existence were employed by a trust which was in effect made up of parents.
The ongoing involvement of parents is also written into the constitution of each of the schools.
The exact form varies, but in all there is parental input to all the bodies connected with the management of the school.
The parents� council is open to all parents and meets regularly to discuss finance, management, staffing and curriculum matters.
All of this means that parental involvement is institutionalised in a much more extensive and formal way than in most schools, and there is the potential for a much closer interaction between parents and teachers.
The founding parents clearly intended that a new type of relationship should be established and one in which the balance of influence between the two groups would be tilted towards the parents.
However, even when complex structures have been established, translating the new relationship into reality proves a complex and difficult process.
Both parents and teachers raised a number of issues which cause concern.
The period of transition from the founding phase, during which the parents have very direct inputs, to the running phase, where the teachers move to a more central position, has been difficult for both groups.
During the period before the school opened to pupils the parents were actively working in the school building and taking many of the practical decisions.
At this stage they felt that the school was �really ours�, but once the teaching began and more of the decisions became traditional educational ones, they felt less confident and experienced a sense of �losing the school�.
One parent said, �It seems to be run much like other schools now.
The role of parents has become normalised�.
The teachers who had been involved since the school opened also expressed nostalgia, particularly about the first year of the school�s operation.
At that stage schools were small and teachers felt that they were able to establish closer relationships with their pupils and their families than they had ever experienced in any other educational setting.
With increasing numbers they felt this was slipping away.
The teachers also felt that there were problems about coming into a situation where parents had already made many decisions, both about the actual physical layout of the school and about the role which they wanted to play in the school�s future.
At a purely practical level they sometimes found it disconcerting to be working with parents on painting classrooms on Saturday, socialising on a first name basis and with the parent as the expert; and then trying to establish a different set of relationships on Monday when the same parent came into the classroom to discuss their child�s progress in reading.
In some cases teachers felt that they faced situations of divided loyalty since the demarcations between parents and teachers were no longer clear cut.
But when she said that she did not think it was a problem, there was a danger of being accused of �siding with the parents�, and this could increase tension in situations where pressure of work was already putting everyone under stress.
The schools had established structures at the beginning to try to regularise and formalise parental involvement and the relationship between parents and teachers.
But they had no models to guide them and even the definition of the relationship itself posed problems.
But the precise relationship between the teachers and the Parents� Council seemed unclear.
In some cases teachers attended the Council as observers, whilst in others there was a formal report from the Council to the teachers.
The Parents� Councils were set up as the central channel through which parents can air their views and formulate requests to the teaching staff.
Ideally the Council should be the equivalent of a staff meeting and could be a valuable structure for formalising parental input into school policy and hence parent-teacher relationships.
In fact attendance by parents at council meetings was quite low in some instances and this was giving rise to concern.
Some of the founder parents felt that the problem was that �newcomers did not understand the original aims� and so did not see how important the Council was.
There is nothing magical about it�.
Others felt that the Council meetings did not address the central educational issues, �parents should be able to seek explanations from the teachers at meetings, for example about teaching methods, without anyone feeling embarrassed�.
At present the parents are not sure how to get involved.
The seeds of disillusionment could also be detected in some responses, such as the comment, �I was impressed in the early exciting heady days by what appeared to be on offer - the opportunity to help shape the curriculum ... this has not been followed through which is a pity because it had great potential�.
At the same time teachers are not sure how to retain their professionalism whilst sharing responsibility and decision making.
Sometimes they feel the parents are holding back �there is still much reticence on the part of the parents, they could get more out of their relationship with the school�.
We felt both groups needed more time to think through the implications of their roles, to consider questions such as whether there is a role for parents in actually planning classroom activities and how much involvement teachers actually want.
It is clear from the interview data that to talk about parent!
teacher relationships as a unitary concept is an oversimplification.
Contact and interaction takes place at a number of levels and in a number of ways.
At the first level there is the personal interaction of the individual parent with the individual teacher.
This may differ little from what would occur in any school, except that it takes place against a background of a school philosophy which places parent / teacher relationships in a different context and therefore quite possibly produces different expectations on both sides.
Then there is the level of the formal structured involvement of the two groups in policy making.
This is much less familiar territory and there is clearly uncertainty amongst both parents and teachers about aims and procedures.
On occasions we felt that some of the difficulties arose, not from disagreement between parents and teachers, but because either the teachers or the parents as a group, had not formulated an agreed position.
Some teachers were much more ambivalent than others about, for example, parental contributions to curriculum development, and these differences made for uncertainty and suspicion when members of staff had to negotiate with parents.
Many, possibly the majority at this stage, welcome involvement but see it primarily as a personal thing relating mainly to their interest in and commitment to their own child's education.
They are satisfied that involvement works if they feel they can talk to teachers in a more relaxed and informal way than they had previously been accustomed to and can go to visit the school without feeling intimidated.
A number of parents said they were now not �afraid� to approach staff.
But there is also a group of parents who want to broaden the concept of involvement into a more general relationship with the school which goes beyond the education of their own children and affects the long term educational philosophy of the school.
They seem to define parental involvement, not only as the personal interaction of parent and teacher over the education of the individual child, but as the exercise of influence over the management and running of the school as an institution, by parents as a group.
This view seems to be held by many of the founder parents, and almost certainly results from their having had to take major decisions about the schools before any teaching staff were appointed.
They see a continuing major role for parents in determining the policy and curriculum of the school and express frustration with what they see as the �lack of vision� of some of the new parents.
The evidence from this study is necessarily provisional but there are indications that the pattern of parent-teacher relations may currently be going in different ways in the primary and secondary schools.
In the primary schools the teachers seem to be on the defensive.
They are anxious that parents may be making too many inroads into areas which they see as their province.
In the secondary schools on the other hand the parents seem to be much more unsure about their role.
They seem to feel that they do not have the competence to make valid inputs into the decision making process.
This is true especially with reference to classroom practice, and perhaps reflects the raised level of academic difficulty of the curriculum material.
This contrast may also be linked to the more general way in which the level of a parent�s involvement in all aspects of their child�s life gradually becomes less close and direct as the child gets older.
Often, too, by this stage, mothers who had given up work when their children were born, may have returned to employment and would be unable to undertake daytime activities to help the school.
At primary level, especially when the child first enters school, the parents have a very direct sense of involvement (Farquhar,1986; Hannon,1986; Hannon,1990).
They are likely to visit the school with the child, talk to the staff about the practicalities of the school day and then accompany and collect the child daily at least to begin with.
This regular direct contact, linked with the integrated school�s stated policy of building up a partnership between parents and teachers means that most of the parents do not feel intimidated by contact with the school.
In addition they feel they know the child better than the teacher and thus have valid inputs into any discussion.
There is also the issue of the professional status of primary teachers and the general estimation made of the skills they have to exercise and the level of specialist knowledge needed to present learning tasks to young children.
Although many parents do appreciate the magnitude of this task, there is still some sense that because the academic level of the content presented is limited it �can�t be that difficult to do�.
All of this, coupled with the natural anxiety parents feel over a child�s early progress in numeracy and literacy, creates a climate in which some parents at least are keen to take advantage of the chance to have a say about the curriculum and teaching methods.
For the teachers this can very easily become threatening and led some of them to interpret what a parent sees as �interest� as �interference�.
As a defence some were anxious to establish boundaries, both to the contexts in which issues could be raised and to the areas where parental input was legitimate.
This remains an area where negotiation will be needed and individual integrated primary schools will have to evolve a pattern which respects the views of both groups.
In the secondary schools the balance seems to be rather different.
By this stage the parents are still anxious to be informed but they are usually less sure of their competence to make direct inputs about teaching methods and content.
So concern focuses on the need to ensure that children achieve success in external examinations as a way of gaining access to higher or further education, training or employment.
The parents are just as concerned as at primary level but do not feel they know enough about syllabuses or examination structures to be able to contribute directly to the formulation of the curriculum.
In this situation it is the parents who feel threatened and who need supportive structures to enable them to raise issues and ask questions without the fear of �looking foolish�.
The secondary schools are also considerably larger than the primary schools, so there may be more practical difficulties about parents and teachers meeting and this in itself may necessitate more formal structures.
The problem in the integrated secondary schools does not seem to be that parents will �interfere� but that, unless new patterns are firmly established, the reality of parental involvement may come to mean little more than the typical activities of a parent teacher group in any other school.
This section on the relationships between parents and teachers may seem to present a rather depressing picture.
But as the research progressed we came to see the current diversity as positive.
We would now suggest that a period of some uncertainty is a part of the process of trying to establish new patterns in a situation where neither parents nor teachers has any relevant precedents.
In each school the two groups are evolving from a relatively naive belief in co-operation over children�s education, to facing the reality of shifting attitudes and expectations.
The hope is to generate a measure of practical co-operation, and this is likely to be a long process with each school probably developing a slightly different pattern.
In this final section of the report we want to reiterate and reinforce some of the general issues which seem crucial in understanding the development of the integrated schools to date and which are likely to have major implications for their future.
Time and skill requirements
The time demands were at their maximum during the initial phases of the establishment of each school but they continue to be heavy.
They arise from two main sources, the fact that parents and teachers have had to undertake so many of the responsibilities which would normally fall to a local authority or government department and also from schools' central philosophy of consultation.
This raises a number of questions which in the light of changes towards greater parental involvement and increased local management of all schools, have implications outside Northern Ireland (Halpin,1990; Howell,1990).
A situation in which each individual school handles its own interactions with every outside agency does raise issues about efficiency.
In the early stages it was probably inevitable that problems had to be tackled on an individual basis, but now the schools are beginning to think about possible structures which might enable them to co-ordinate some aspects of planning in order to cut down the volume of work for each set of governors, parents and teachers.
On a very practical level can teachers, and especially teaching principals, be expected to undertake such a wide range of management tasks.
The teachers themselves expressed concern about the effect on the quality of their teaching of having to do this over long periods of time.
In some cases there may even be a risk to the physical health of those involved.
Although such things are hard to quantify, in both cases it does seem that stress was one of the major factors involved.
Similarly there must be uncertainty about whether large numbers of parents can be expected to input so much time and skill indefinitely.
Our evidence suggests that parents want to be involved in their children's education but that for most this does not imply a wish or even a willingness to be heavily committed to meetings on a regular basis.
Commitment and motivation
Up to now in the integrated schools these very heavy requirements for time and skill inputs from parents and teachers have been sustained out of the very strong commitment to the concept of integration.
Almost all of those strongly connected with the schools are anxious to improve community relations in Northern Ireland and see work for the integrated schools as one practical way of contributing to this process.
For many in the core groups behind each school there is a strong link to their religious or political beliefs.
