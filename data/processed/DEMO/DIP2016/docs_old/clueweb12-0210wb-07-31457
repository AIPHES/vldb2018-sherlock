The Cathedral Religious Education program is designed to help your child grow spiritually at their individual level of experience and comprehension.
Integral to each class session is an understanding of the gospel message of Jesus Christ; its application to their lives as Catholic Christians, and the teachings and traditions of our church.
Please realize that the program is meant only to supplement your vocation as a parent.
This vocation covers everything from caring for your childs daily needs, chauffeuring him or her to and from school or other activities, playing ball with him or her, to saying nighttime prayers.
What you do and say during daily life teaches more to your child then we can ever hope to accomplish in one hour of instruction per week.
As you minister to your children, I ask you to be especially mindful of the following expectations, which are in keeping with the basic tenets of the Catholic Christian tradition.
All Nashville television stations will be asked to announce Cathedral Religious Education cancellations.
