You will receive a termly outline of the areas of study your child will be working on to encourage discussion, homework support and maybe visits you might want to make to places of interest in connection with the curriculum.
All sports are encouraged as a vital part of our healthy school approach.
Boys and girls take part in football, netball, athletics, rounders, cricket and swimming across the Borough and south-east England.
This sometimes includes inter-school games and galas.
Religious Worship and Instruction
Arrangements for religious worship and instruction - Religious Education is provided at the school in accordance with the Bexley London Borough's Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education.
If requested in writing by the parents, a pupil may be excused from attendance at religious worship and/or instruction.
Each class teacher provides pastoral care.
It is taught in Year 6 and covers topics such as growing up, puberty, reproduction and the concept of caring for a new life.
Sometimes this will happen formally, but more often informally without the children realising, such as marking work or in noting children's oral responses to planned questions.
Reading is a vital part of this - to foster a love of books (or the written word on-line, in whatever form) is one of the most precious gifts you can give to your child.
