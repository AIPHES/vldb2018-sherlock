./clueweb12-0307wb-03-30394:In some cases this was related to a view that �there�s too much religion in Ireland anyway�, and in others to a fear that in an overtly Christian school those of other religions or none might not be totally comfortable or feel fully valued.
./clueweb12-0307wb-03-30394:Existing evidence suggests that children of mixed marriages are frequently brought up in the religion of the mother, and attend the appropriate school, and that this is particularly so when the mother is a Roman Catholic (Compton, 1989).
./clueweb12-0307wb-03-30394:Although she taught Religious Education within the school she felt that religion should be the concern of the family and should not determine the choice of school.
./clueweb12-0307wb-03-30394:This approach was being closely linked to integration through the concept that only pupils who were confident of their own value could in turn value and respect others, especially others who differed from them in religion, culture or political aspirations.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:General Rule: Public schools may not teach religion, although teaching about religion in a secular context is permitted.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:What distinguishes "teaching religion" from "teaching about religion"?
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Programs that "teach about religion" are geared toward teaching students about the role of religion in the historical, cultural, literary and social development of the United States and other nations.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:When discussing religion in this context, religion must be discussed in a neutral, objective, balanced and factual manner.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Nor may it have the effect of promoting or inhibiting religion.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:A teacher must not promote or denigrate any particular religion, religion in general, or lack of religious belief.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:A program intended to teach religion, disguised as teaching about religion, will be found unconstitutional.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:In sum, there is a critical difference between teaching religion and teaching about religion.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:While it is constitutionally permissible for public schools to teach about religion, it is unconstitutional for public schools and their employees to observe religious holidays, promote religious belief, or practice religion.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:School officials and parents must be extremely careful not to cross the line between "the laudable educational goal of promoting a student's knowledge of and appreciation for this nation's cultural and religious diversity, and the impermissible endorsement of religion forbidden by the Establishment Clause."
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:The fact that most religions also teach these values does not change the lawfulness and desirability of teaching them.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:What are some concerns that arise regarding "teaching about religion" in public schools?
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Although it is legal to teach about religion in public schools in a neutral and secular manner, school administrators, teachers and parents should be cognizant of the inherent dangers of bringing religion into the classroom.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Any discussion of religion in the classroom should be sensitive to the beliefs of the different students in the class.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:If religion is discussed, great care must be taken to discuss minority as well as majority religions.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:The inclusion of only the major religions in a classroom discussion does not reflect the actual religious diversity within our society and the world.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Every effort should be made to obtain accurate information about different religions.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Special training may be required to prepare teachers to discuss religion in an appropriate manner.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those students who are being raised with no religious faith.

./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:The students must only be required to read and discuss the material and may not be required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by their religion.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Aren't these rules just promoting a "secular religion"?
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:The state may not establish a "religion of secularism" in the sense that the state may not affirmatively oppose or show hostility to religion, thereby preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:33 That being said, the prohibition on teaching religion and religious activity ensures that the government does not advance or promote religious belief over non-religious belief or a particular religious belief over other religious beliefs.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:Simply, the public schools should work to ensure that they do not endorse or disapprove religion, neither promoting nor denigrating it.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:However, the school must ensure that the standard reader neither promotes nor opposes religion, and that Joe is merely required to read and discuss the material and is not required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by his religion.
./clueweb12-1516wb-69-26587:"Teaching religion" amounts to religious indoctrination and practice and is clearly prohibited in public schools.

./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:We are not a "Christian society", an unsupported viewpoint presented at the meeting, we are instead a complex blend of different cultures, religions and values.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Some members stated that they didn't practice religion in their homes but would not be bothered it their child learnt about it.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:This begs the question: if the Koran was the religion that was chosen to be presented this year, would they still be interested in having religion taught to their children?
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:If they are practising religion in the home, then their church and home based celebrations should more than suffice in their spiritual needs.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I feel that many members who do not practice religion were inclined to simply agree with the majority, which is a common response in group situations where individuals fear having a different opinion.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:My personal belief is that religion should be optional.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I do not believe that children should remain ignorant to religion, but I would prefer that they understand the basics of a multitude of perspectives, so they could then make an informed decision, should they wish to pursue a religion.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:9th August 05 Hi All, I'd be interested to read any information you have about religion in state schools - I've already seen the article about chaplaincy in schools in SA.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:It seems the majority of people accept these positions without bothering to scrutinise and there also seems to be a feeling that religion is exempt from being questioned in society.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:When religion enters education, rational brain activity ceases.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:They can't wait until children become rational young adults and ask questions to which the only answer religion can provide is, "have faith..." they'd have no new members!
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:And, having been mentally 'unmanned', so to speak as far as religion goes, you're unable to question the idea of an immortal soul - something that has no physical existence whatsoever, yet which contains the total essence of a person so that when he/she dies that 'thing' will go to another place [for which there is no shred of evidence] and "live" - experiencing all the emotions, feelings and sensations of a living human.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Such an action would be seen as ethical in order to promote their religion.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I was wondering on the legality of this because he only represents the christian religion and I feel that this is wrong and he constantly does such annoying stupid fundy things as attack evolution with ridiculous arguments and he is generally very fake and I believe he is here to win over the 'souls' of the kids there.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:When I completed the enrolment form, I stated that he did not have a religion, and I was not warned that he may be subjected to religious content in the teaching.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:There simply is no choice; religion or nothing, inclusion and feeling equal or exclusion and alienation.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I called the other day to ask about religion in Uniting Church owned preschools.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:, - following their own policies, and make them have more variety in the religions they are presenting to reflect the mix in the class (which they are currently not doing - though the area is highly Christian so there would not be many other religions at the centre).
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:So I was wondering if you can suggest any preschool age appropriate (4yrs) materials on humanism or atheism etc that we could ask to be included to represent our families personal views on religion to add another perspective?
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:My husband wants to ignore the issue with her totally as he is worried our emphasis on religion (even our explanation that we don't believe in it due to a lack of evidence and logical basis) will make it more ingrained in her little head which can't yet comprehend using reason and science rather than myth.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:"While religious beliefs and traditions may be brought into the service in some form as they are part of the lives of members of the community, a service, unless its community has one religion shared by all, will not endorse or embrace a particular set of religious customs and beliefs.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:(not decline) Obviously, this is to prevent any accidental religious education which could be seriously offensive to certain other religions and the non-religious.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I visited your webpage recently and totally agree with banning religion from secular schools.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Australia needs to change to accommodate the multitude of people learning that religion has no part in our community and joining other schools around the world and banning it from be taught.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I replied to the class teacher that I wish my child to be taught about religion in a comparative context rather than in an exclusive context; which is why she will not be attending, and that I hope the kids that don't attend are given something fun to do rather than being singled out.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:If other parents want their kids to be indoctrinated in religion at school that's their business but I don't see why it should prevent my children from continuing to get an education during this time.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I would like to run classes on Atheism as an alternative and a lot of parents at the school would support this - do you know if there has been any attempt to get Atheism approved as a religion for the purpose of this policy?
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:The website of the Department of education and training fact sheet on Secular Schools reads "The principal of secular education by which the legislation clearly states the government school system is secular and open to the adherents of any philosophy, religion or faith.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I believe that religious teachings (scripture) should be completely banned from all State/Public schools across NSW - not to advocate against Christianity, but as a matter of principle - and to allow for the proper separation of state and religion.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I take this to mean that prayers on parade be ceased, and later, if necessary and the school community approves, replaced by readings done by individuals as opposed to all children being coerced, and providing a number of different religions (not just Christian) are included.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Secularism is about keeping the state and religion separate, the way it should be - not privileging religion of any faith.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:What is your assessment of my proposal that religion in NSW public schools should be completely banned, as this indoctrination fosters a separatist society in NSW?
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I was wondering under what provision of the education act this introduction of religion occurs?
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:I understand that many in our population NEED religion to get by, and I do respect that it is their choice, but I feel I was disrespected at this meeting, as you will read.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Dear xxxxxx I would like to formally document my concern for the practice of incorporating religion into the curriculum at xxxxxx Preschool, as discussed at the committee meeting on 10 August.
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:We must ask ourselves: "What has religion got to do with pre-school?"
./clueweb12-0911wb-15-11641:Therefore, the Christian religion is not required to ensure that children behave in a manner that is morally and socially acceptable.

./clueweb12-0202wb-22-35402:The situation is different with voluntary aided schools where there can be a high number of criteria relating to religion and religious practice, creating difficulties for parents/carers and allowing scope for discretion in many cases.
./clueweb12-0202wb-22-35402:The survey, released to coincide with the committee stage of the Equality Bill, found that 57% of people 'agreed or strongly agreed' that "state funded schools that select students by their religion undermine community cohesion", while only 19% 'disagreed or strongly disagreed'.

./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:While many of us believe that the SRI syllabus educates our children about comparative religions and their history, many parents report that the truth is for them very different.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:ACCESS Ministries is the "default" provider of instruction in religion in the state curriculum, by ministerial and statutory authority.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:Perhaps more significantly, there is now a majority of parents who do not practice or subscribe to any religion at all.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:The Department of Education effectively privileges and promotes this group of Protestant Christians over all other faith-based religions or beliefs with the active encouragement of ACCESS.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:SRI is most certainly not, as many have been led to believe, the teaching of comparative religions or religious history.

./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:Given the increased focus on religion in the public sphere globally, this area of public education is lacking in Australia, with many public school students showing disturbing levels of ignorance about faith communities in their own neighbourhoods.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:Victoria could lead the way for other parts of Australia by developing a much more inclusive, critically focused approach to education about religions and beliefs.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:Victoria's system, is failing to serve the interests of children and religions, because it presents children religious instruction divorced from the diverse traditions and practices of the many religious communities amongst us.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:We need to educate our children about the full range of religions that matter to us, and respect the basic point that families have a fundamental right in how their children are religiously instructed but that this should be outside of the normal school curriculum.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:Ultimately schools should teach about religion, not instruct children in religion.
./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:This is no longer the believe of many Christian religions, the teaching of Genisis is better suited to Sunday school , than a secular classroom.

./clueweb12-1717wb-00-02905:I am quite happy for those who wish their child to have a religious education, whatever that religion may be, to have access to their faith, however I do feel that the best qualified people to do this are the parents themselves and the leaders of the parents' church/faith.

./clueweb12-1802wb-22-19784:The history on this point is quite clear - the system itself was not about giving minority faiths "access", it was only because of the manifest injustice that the policy had to be granted to other religions - and the system is totally abusive of families who choose not to follow religion.
./clueweb12-1802wb-22-19784:All of the scholarly inquiry into this points at the value of a rounded, comparative, and objective inquiry into religions.
./clueweb12-1802wb-22-19784:Families are perfectly capable of choosing and engaging in religion - the Minister of Education should not negotiate with "faith instructors" in order to introduce sectarian programs in the schools - this is exactly what is happening here, and raising the concerns of organizations in the business of doing "faith instruction" above the interests of teachers and families is a violation of the basic rights of citizens in a society based on the idea of religious toleration and freedom.
./clueweb12-1000wb-03-19038:We welcome the fact that many public schools now teach about our nation�s diversity and the role of religion in human life and history, and applaud the schools� efforts to promote those virtues necessary for good citizenship in a pluralistic democracy.
./clueweb12-1000wb-03-19038:Just as we encourage schools to ensure that all religions are treated with fairness and respect, so we urge parents and others to refrain from the temptation to use public schools to advance the cause of any one religion or ethnic tradition, whether through curriculum or through efforts to attach religious personnel to the public schools.
./clueweb12-1000wb-03-19038:Believing that the First Amendment, along with the Equal Access Act, provides an adequate and sufficient guarantee of the religious liberty of students and their parents, we oppose any efforts to alter the First Amendment�s prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion.

./clueweb12-1801wb-20-15071:The interests of "Faith Instructors" should not be confused with the basic rights of "citizens", no matter how much the faith instructors say it is their right to "teach their faith" - this wish should never be spun into legislation - or putting the government in the business of endorsing, accrediting or even so much as reviewing for its educational suitability - a course designed to instruct children in the beliefs and tenets of religion.

./clueweb12-0012wb-70-34152:The constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, as interpreted in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, prohibits a public school from giving students the impression that it prefers or sanctions a particular religion, or religion generally.
./clueweb12-0012wb-70-34152:A Christmas concert dominated by religious carols, Christian music in the school office, and a creationism video in science class with a theological message are not reflective of religious neutrality, but instead appear to be school endorsement of the Christian religion.
./clueweb12-0012wb-70-34152:A sturdy wall separating church and state is essential to preserving and promoting freedom of religion in our increasingly pluralistic nation.

./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:I bet you, if there was such a subject, many parents would be up in arms at having their children exposed to other religions with differing views and gods.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:To finish up, it's not really to do with teaching religion in schools but I find it unfair and at odds that people cannot teach in a religious school unless you have been acredited to do so but at the same time, the people of the same background can just waltz right in and preach...I meant teach.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:I think it is plain for any objectors to the FIRIS campaign to see that the overwhelming theme is that the majority of parents, including myself, want eduction for their children about different religions and ethics, not regarding a particular religion as is the current situation.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:I believe there should be a religious studies programme in State schools teaching about many of the world religions and taught by trained teachers as I do believe it is very important to learn about the religious beliefs and traditions in order to encourage and nurture understanding ,tolerance and delight in the diversity.All the main religions share the basic Golden Rule-do unto others what you would have them do to you or expressed as don't do to another that which you would not like done to you.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:Your campaign seems aimed at allowing more religions more access to our children.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:If individuals want to indulge in religion, they should do so in their own time, and teach their children their religious doctrine outside school.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:If you want to teach for an hour a week without pay, a class that embraces all religions then go ahead.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:So I support the teaching of other religions, but not by taking away a culture that has been happening in our school system since the first school was established.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:The reason this "movement" wont take any affect is if you continue to allow the extremist views AGAINST other religions to post on your site.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:Hi Liam: If we have allowed any comments that are intended to harm others, please notify us - there are many people in Australia who have left religion, and want to raise their children outside of religious teaching, we've found that many of these people have had personal experiences that have led them to have a negative view of religion - a secular society is one that explicitly recognizes the right of citizens to choose and pursue religion outside of the authority of government, but institutions that are set up for "the public" should not be venues for Christian Ministry - that is what churches are for - and as you say we are blessed with a wide diversity of religious traditions in Australia.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:There is a much higher percentage of atheists and agnostics now as well as well as all of the other major religions being well represented in our multicultural society.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:The number of actively practicing Christians is dropping and what we are basically saying is that we would be happier for our children to be taught comparative religion not just Christianity as not all of us are Christian ie if religious education must be done within school hours.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:The fact that there is so much heated debate on this topic only illustrates how deeply personal the subject of religion is for most of us and hence why the teaching of one specific religion only should not play a role in modern government schools.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:Follow an objective, fair and balanced comparative syllabus for education about religions and beliefs 4.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:You can remove these discriminating barriers that are separating us in order to create a more equitable school environment that caters to open and critical thinking, such as a course taught by University trained personnel in comparative religion / ethics / philosophy.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:With respect politically, I always find it strange how our conservative politicians favor economic privatization but don't apply the same free-market ethos to religion?
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:My son is in his Prep year at the moment and I was under the misguided assumption that he was being taught about all religions and that the class was being delivered by a qualified teacher.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:Just what else do the people who voted for aim no. 4 think the religions want to do at their school premises outside of school hours?
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:I implore you to make a 180 degree about-face on aim 4 insisting that no religious group or person can enter the school grounds AT ANY TIME WHATSOEVER to promote or undertake any action that could be seen to be promoting any religion in any manner whatsoever.
./clueweb12-1800wb-30-00829:How exactly you view transparency and equality to be "devastating and appalling" is difficult to understand, unless what you are saying is that the existence of religion is itself "appalling".
./clueweb12-1506wb-43-10888:Education is central to strictly Orthodox life, in terms of socializing children in the religion and in the 'ways of righteousness'.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Darin I believe that all kids at a certain age should have sex education classes, but homosexuality and especially religion should not be discussed in the classroom.

./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Nothing breeds misunderstanding and discrimination more than people who simply are not educated on differences between people and religions.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Discussions and teaching of religion in a classroom very clearly violates the rights of people who want to raise their children free from religious influence.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:If passed, Bill 44 will allow parents to pull their kids from classroom discussions about religion, sexuality or sexual orientation.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Amendments to Bill 44 has many components but the most contentious change focuses on allowing parents to pull their kids from classroom discussions about religion, sexuality or sexual orientation.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:"I think it's nice to have the power to say 'I'd like to do that in the home, I'd like to discuss religion or homosexuality in the home,'" says one parent.

./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Both topics are covered in religion classes.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:The real issue is that people don't have the right to speak, practice their religion or to associate (fundamental freedoms) are under attack from the Alberta Human Rights Multiculturalism and Citizenship Commission.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:My education also taught me about many other religions.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:Teaching people about other religions (which yes you learn about in a catholic school) is a great way to learn about different cultures and teach respect to others beliefs.
./clueweb12-1217wb-24-09945:I also learned tolerance through peer interaction as well as within my religious studies classes where I learned not only about Catholicism but Hinduism, Buddhism, Mormonism and other religions.
./clueweb12-0303wb-36-23796:"It's accommodating one religion in lieu of all the others," she said of Muslim prayer.
./clueweb12-0303wb-36-23796:"Islam teaches there is no coercion in religion," Mabashir Mumtaz said.
./clueweb12-0600wb-01-35073:In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court wrote that it did not believe the danger that ''children would misperceive the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the club were excluded from the public forum.''
./clueweb12-0600wb-01-35073:Those who oppose the clubs said their underlying intention is to change someone's religion on public school grounds, and that Child Evangelism Fellowship's target is not necessarily restricted to the 7-year-old child in the Good News Club.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:To show how religion forms an integral part of peoples lives.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Work in the first year will be involved with the study of festivals of the major religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'The study of the main religions of the world has an obvious educational justification in its own right, but the need for deeper understanding of the beliefs and customs of immigrant pupils may urge more concentration on one or two religions instead of a superficial world tour ... Some theological faculties seem to go on with their traditional questions and problems.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The meeting of world religions, the need for dialogue between them, has still no significant place in many theological schools and seminaries.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Since the groups which have sought to establish these schools are of a clearly religious character it is often argued that their efforts represent nothing more than an attempt to extend the existing dual system of educational provision in this country to embrace other faiths which are now part of British society, and the resistance and antagonism which such attempts have aroused have been seen as manifestations of institutional racism in that the 'system' is failing to accord equal treatment to the religions of ethnic minority groups.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Where there was some parental resistance (usually from the majority community) to studying religions other than Christianity, it was felt that this could best be overcome through 'parent education' - explaining to parents what the school was endeavouring to achieve through its religious education programme.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Whilst some teachers took the view that, if asked, they should explain and defend their own beliefs to their pupils, others deliberately avoided expressing their own views in the classroom, in the belief that these would inevitably condition pupils' perception of different religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Several of the religious education teachers felt that they often had a particular insight into the needs and concerns of ethnic minority pupils and their families because of their understanding of the influence of religion on their lives, and were therefore able to act as catalysts within the school to encourage curriculum development on a broader front.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.18 Several teachers expressed concern to us about the difficulties of obtaining textbooks and teaching materials which reflected a multi-faith view of religious education and which did not present religions other than Christianity in negative or inaccurate terms.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Whilst it was acknowledged that out of date textbooks which misrepresented other religions might cause offence to adherents of these faiths, the view was also expressed that such textbooks might themselves provide a valuable subject for discussion with pupils since they raised issues relating to stereotyping, religious prejudice and how non-believers could perceive other faiths.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The syllabus should thus be used to enlarge and deepen the pupils' understanding of religion by studying world religions, and by exploring all those elements in human experience which raise questions about life's ultimate meaning and value.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:This involves informing pupils in a descriptive, critical and experiential manner about what religion is, and increasing their sensitivity to the areas of experience from which a religious view of life may arise.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:This is not to deny that the Christian religion is still a source of guidance and inspiration for many people living in the city, and that Christianity is part of our heritage.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.13 Since the appearance of the Birmingham syllabus, a number of other authorities, including Hampshire to which we have already referred, have developed similarly broad agreed syllabuses which focus on developing children's understanding and appreciation of the nature of belief itself and of a range of belief systems, rather than seeking to convert or confirm children into any particular religion or ideology whether Christian or non-Christian.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Awareness of the contribution of religion to human culture e.g. acquiring knowledge of the ways in which the Christian heritage has influenced social life in different parts of the UK.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.5 Since the 1944 Education Act saw an act of collective worship as an integral part of a school's provision for religious education, we begin by considering the specific issues which have arisen in relation to this aspect of schools' work, before looking at the place of religion within the school curriculum.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Other multi-racial schools have sought to give some recognition to religions other than Christianity through including references to religious festivals from other faiths in assemblies, while a number of schools have continued with a traditional Christian-oriented act of worship.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Religious festivals from major religions are looked at as are parables from world religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is important to recognise that the faiths of these minority communities are in no sense 'minority' religions, but are major faiths which have often played a leading role in shaping world history.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'Religions and culture are closely interwoven and often religion is the very "soul" of culture.'
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Any consideration of religious education must recognise that there has long been an emotive and often passionate debate about the role of schools in relation to religion in a society which can be seen as increasingly secular in terms of the level of active religious observance amongst the majority of its members: a debate to which the multi-faith character of schools with substantial ethnic minority populations has now added a further dimension.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'... in religious education, the school is operating on the boundary between itself and the local community in that it is dealing with the religious traditions, beliefs and values of the society in which it is set ... Religious education shares with other subjects the task of helping children to acquire the skills, knowledge and social competence necessary for their personal development and life in society ... However, religious education also makes a distinctive contribution to the curriculum in directing attention to the religious understanding of human life and to the central values (many of them derived from religion) which society seeks to uphold and to transmit.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:In this consideration of religion and values, the intention is to help pupils to understand the nature of religious questions and religious affirmations, and to develop a personal and intellectual integrity in dealing with the profoundest aspects of their own experience now and in adult life.'
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.2 It must also be recognised however that religious education is seen by many as a particularly difficult aspect of the educational experience to define since the phrase itself seems to be almost a contradiction in terms - the task of education being to teach children to exercise flexibility of mind and to seek rational explanations for situations, whilst the essence of religion is seen by many as belief, and in many faiths, an acceptance of revelation.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.3 Before considering the various interpretations which have been placed on religious education, it must be acknowledged that the very principle of religion having a place within the school curriculum has been challenged on the grounds that schools exist primarily to equip their pupils with a range of practical skills and factual information and it is beyond their role and responsibility to seek to educate pupils in an area of experience which is uniquely personal and in which there is no single accepted corpus of knowledge.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:They therefore reject the concept of religious education seeing it as a form of indoctrination which seeks to 'impose' religion on young people.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'We accept the right of those who do not subscribe to any religion to refuse to be a party to religious education for their children ... But they have no right to deny religious education to those who want it.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:There appears to be a "spiritual dimension" in man 50 nature which requires to be expressed by "religion" of one kind or another.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:For some, it is an Eastern religion; for some it is Christianity; for others it is one of the secular creeds of the West, for example Marxism; for others it is agnostic humanism; for many it may be little more than moral stoicism.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:They should have some opportunity to learn that religion is a feature of this condition.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Enquiry Pupils should be developing the ability to find and record information about religion from books of various kinds, including the Bible and other sacred writings, and from audio-visual materials; and they should be able to listen to, and put relevant questions to, religious believers about their faith and practice.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Expression Pupils should be developing the ability to describe and explain religious ideas and practices, and their own personal views and feelings about religion, in a variety of ways - straightforward written prose, of course, also orally in discussion and conversation, and in poetry, painting, drama, dance and music.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Interpretation Pupils should be developing the ability to recognise metaphors and symbols when they are studying religion, and should be able' to explain their significance.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:1.1 Describing: Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the main historical and symbolic stories in the Bible, and in the sacred writings of other world religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Examples include the creation stories in the Bible and creation stories in other world religions; Noah, Abraham, Moses, the principal kings and prophets of the Old Testament; the life of Jesus; Paul and the early church; the life of Muhammad; Guatama Buddha; Guru Nanak; stories in the sacred scriptures of the Hindus.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.1 Describing: Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the moral teachings of Christianity and of other great world religions, as outlined in precepts and commandments, and in parables and other stories.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Examples include the religious experience of Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Paul; of the founders of other world religions; of ordinary religious believers over the centuries; the ways in which religious experience is expressed in metaphors, poetry, painting, music.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:5.1 Describing: Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the historical development of religious traditions; the different kinds of social organisation which religions have adopted; and the art, literature, music and architecture which religions have inspired.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:5.2 Understanding: Pupils should be developing the ability to explain the significance of religious history and culture for believers, and the influence which religion has exerted, and continues to exert, on social and cultural life in general, both in this country and throughout the world.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:7.1 Describing: Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the main questions about human nature and the human condition, and about the personal identity and purpose in life of individuals, to which religions provide answers or responses.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It does not seek to promote anyone religious viewpoint but it recognises that the study of religion must transcend the merely informative ...'
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.8 The phenomenological or non-denominational and undogmatic view draws a clear distinction between what can strictly speaking be termed 'religious instruction' i.e. instruction in a religion, and 'religious education' i.e. education in the concept of religion and in the range of belief systems which exist.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is seen as the function of the home and of the religious community to nurture and instruct a child in a particular faith (or not), and the function of the school to assist pupils to understand the nature of religion and to know something of the diversity of belief systems, their significance for individuals and how these bear on the community.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The essential distinction between the confessional and the phenomenological approach to Christianity within religious education is, however, that whereas the former approach would tend to present Christianity as the only 'true' religion and, if any reference was made to other religions, would present these solely in Christian terms, the latter would more accurately reflect the multiplicity of beliefs and non-beliefs including Christianity - now present in society.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The National Secular Society, for example, suggests that the study of religion on these terms should be included as part of the history syllabus ...
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The confessional approach to religious education can be seen as the traditional view of the role of the school in relation to religion which was without doubt the approach which the framers of the 1944 Education Act had in mind in requiring schools to provide 'religious instruction' (see paragraph 3.2 below) - their terminology indeed indicates clearly that they saw the task for religious education as inculcating young people into a specific religious faith: Christianity.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'The tradition of our national life has been largely shaped and sustained by behaviour and ideas closely associated with the practice of religion, and particularly the Christian religion.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is regrettable that this view of religious education has led to concern in some quarters that Christianity risks being submerged within a 'Cook's tour' of the world's religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'... while recognising that a truly pluralist society - if such we are - should not merely tolerate diversity but value and nurture it, I must also express the fear that at times we seem tempted to sacrifice too much of our native Christian tradition on the altar of multiculturalism ... when I read, in one approved syllabus, of the need in religious education "to set Christianity alongside other religions", as if it were part of some creedal smorgasbord, or that "it should be part of an education for life in this country that children come to know something of the traditional religion of the land, namely Christianity" (as if Christianity was, like Shakespeare, parliamentary democracy or roast beef, part of a living heritage rather than a living faith), I wonder whether we are not, as Christian educators, selling Christianity short by carrying our anti-confessionalism too far.'
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The intention of the phenomenological approach to religious education is however in no way to 'reduce' Christianity to simply one element in an arid survey of world religions, but rather to set the consideration of Christianity, in all its spiritual depth and fullness, within a wider context of the true significance of the religious dimension to life, in all its forms.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.10 Much of the evidence which we have received from ethnic minority communities has related to the provision of religious education in schools and particularly to the place accorded to religions other than Christianity.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It was pointed out to us that religions such as Islam and Sikhism are major world faiths in a global context and are in no way therefore 'minority' religions, inferior to Christianity, simply because they might have fewer adherents in this country.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The view of religious education mentioned above held by some sections of certain ethnic minority religious communities can be seen, if taken to its logical conclusion of children from a particular faith community being 'instructed' only in their own religion, as also in the confessional spirit but, in terms of the nature of the educational provision made - i.e. with different groups of children receiving different forms of religious education - as separatist in effect.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Total absorption of minority groups into 'mainstream' eradication of culture and religion; notion of normativeness.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:ethnic minority origin, it was pointed out that if this approach were adopted in schools seeking to cover a range of world faiths this would necessitate perhaps four or five teachers 'representing' the different religions, which would clearly not be feasible.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Since the philosophy of the phenomenological approach to religious education was however not to teach children a religion but rather to teach children to understand the nature of belief and a range of belief systems, it was felt that this attitude was unjustified.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Not surprisingly there was a serious shortage of such teachers since until the implementation of the Act, religion could not be offered as a qualifying subject for the teacher's certificate.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Obviously the parents would not particularly want to send their children to a school of another religion ... Once the school becomes an all white school there will be a strong demand to create a Sikh school.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:With regard to the treatment of religion, the emphasis in many of the submissions which we have received is, as we have already recalled in the first part of this chapter, on the need to instruct and confirm the pupils in their Islamic faith through a 'confessional' style approach and although it has been suggested that Muslim schools might admit some non-Muslim pupils the intention would still be to offer different religious groups instruction in their own religions.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Many of these differences of emphasis arise from the apparent irreconcilability of the requirements of a religion, which of its very nature influences every aspect of an individual's life, and the pressures of our secular society.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:If they have separate schools which instil an exclusive culture, religion and education, what aspect of their life will be relevant to the community?
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Curiosity Pupils should be developing an interest in religious beliefs and practices, and in the main questions and issues with which religions are concerned.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Critical Mind Pupils should be developing an inclination to examine ideas about religion critically, and to be on their guard against bias, indoctrination, superstition and falsehood.
./clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Tolerance Pupils should be developing a willingness to maintain and protect the legal right of religious believers to practice their religion, and also the rights of people not to practise a religion.
./clueweb12-0006wb-53-08077:The mother, however, shares her husband's disinclination to open up serious subjects with the little ones, her own mind being so little set that way; she has her dinner parties to arrange, her dances and balls to organise or attend, her guests to invite or to visit; and so religion goes to the wall, and unless by good fortune there be some old faithful retainer who will instruct her young charges out of her own simple faith, deep must be the ignorance and pitiful the condition of the children of such parents.
./clueweb12-0006wb-53-08077:For middle-class, no less than for upper-class children, nothing can take the place of loving, faithful, earnest teaching at the mother's knee; and to bring this about there must be true religion in the mother's heart.
./clueweb12-0918wb-42-15656:We welcome the fact that many public schools now teach about our nation's diversity and the role of religion in human life and history, and applaud the schools' efforts to promote those virtues necessary for good citizenship in a pluralistic democracy.
./clueweb12-0918wb-42-15656:Just as we encourage schools to ensure that all religions are treated with fairness and respect, so we urge parents and others to refrain from the temptation to use public schools to advance the cause of any one religion or ethnic tradition, whether through curriculum or through efforts to attach religious personnel to the public schools.
./clueweb12-0918wb-42-15656:Consequently, we oppose any efforts to alter the First Amendment's prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion.
./clueweb12-0918wb-42-15656:All parents have an obligation to make sure that their children are well informed about religion and its role in human life and history; parents of faith are free to give their children appropriate religious instruction, in the home or in the religious institution of their choice, including in a parochial school.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:To promote and encourage spiritual/psychological wellbeing in families, relationships and society, the most appropriate path would be to offer a course in philosophy, in which all major religions are discussed and compared, along with the teachings and ideas of great thinkers who worked outside established religions.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:What on earth is "general religion'?
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:Why do people think you have to have a religion?
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:I imagine it is what is sometimes called comparative religion.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:Knowing there are lots of religions all of whose adherents are passionate that theirs is the one true one is a useful thing I think.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:Hmmm, from previous experience, I would guess that any exposure to ethics under the 'general religion' guise would be xtian based and therefore not acceptable to a wide section of Australian society.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:If you mean the thing Howard bought in about chaplains they did't have to be a christian pastor and there were rules about not proselytising for a particular religion.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-06001:And I bet this reverend is wondering why we think that his religion is evil...
./clueweb12-0713wb-71-26094:Children learn the same basic subjects as in conventional public schools but may also study religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-43-01347:We welcome the fact that many public schools now teach about our nation's diversity and the role of religion in human life and history, and applaud the schools' efforts to promote those virtues necessary for good citizenship in a pluralistic democracy.
./clueweb12-0209wb-43-01347:Just as we encourage schools to ensure that all religions are treated with fairness and respect, so we urge parents and others to refrain from the temptation to use public schools to advance the cause of any one religion or ethnic tradition, whether through curriculum or through efforts to attach religious personnel to the public schools.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Yet such changes fail to tackle the fundamental religious freedom problems over the course: the subject remains compulsory, the function of the course - whether it is about religions or the narrow teaching of one faith only (Islam) - is not clarified, exemptions remain limited and require parents to declare their religious or philosophical views, and there is a risk that exempted children suffer bullying from other children and lowered grades from teachers in other subjects.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:To ensure respect for freedom of religion and belief for all in education, Turkey should consider approaching the matter in a holistic manner.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Their compulsory nature, their content lacking objectivity and pluralism, and finally the lack of an adequate framework for exemptions continue to pose problems to the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief in the educational setting in Turkey.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Many in Turkey argue that further reform of primary and secondary school education to facilitate freedom of religion or belief is necessary.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Because the military leadership of 1980 saw the value of a certain form of "restrained religion" as a unifying factor for the nation and as a preventative tool against what it considered marginal movements, a provision was inserted into Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution making RCKE classes compulsory in primary and secondary education.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The same provision goes on to say that "education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be conducted under state supervision and control", explicitly demonstrating the state's strong interest in imposing its control.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Jehovah's Witnesses can be exempted from RCKE classes, either by presenting their ID cards stating that they are Christians (since the state regards Jehovah's Witnesses as a denomination within Christianity, not as a separate religion) or - if the religion section in their ID card is blank - by providing a letter from the Council of Representatives of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:On the one hand, the government claims that the RCKE course synopsis includes teaching about all religions, while on the other there is a limited opt-out possibility.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:If the teaching includes all religions, why does the system allow exemption?
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:"Conversely, if the course is essentially designed to teach the Muslim religion, it is a course on a specific religion and should not be compulsory, in order to preserve children's and their parents' religious freedom."
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The changes made in the textbooks for the 2011/2012 school year to include Alevi and Caferi teachings do not remove the paradox, because the RCKE course still teaches only one religion (Islam) and no adequate exemption is in place.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:On the other hand it is important to note that these improvements alone do not make the RCKE classes a lesson "about religions".
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Also, while this step may satisfy some Alevi groups there are certainly other Alevis who remain categorically against the teaching of religion by the State.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Such changes do not include an appropriate opt-out structure for anyone who finds these lessons to be in conflict with their religious beliefs or philosophical views, nor moving to a course that is "about religions".
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:By contrast, the Emek, Demokrasi ve Özgürlük Blok (Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc), the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) oppose compulsory religion classes.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The Bloc instead proposed history of religions and religious studies as optional lessons.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:In June 2011 the Education Reform Initiative (ERG) of Sabanci University in Istanbul expressed concern about the lack of proposals on the continuation of a democratic, plural and participatory discussion on education about religions instead of religious education.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:He argues that elements that teach a certain religion with the purpose of influencing the child to adopt the religion and its practices must be eliminated, and the lessons should be strictly "about religions".
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Bermek also notes that calls to reject entirely any religion classes polarise society and cause the discussions to revolve around whether or not to have religion lessons, rather than on the content.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The Chair of the Association of Protestant Churches, Zekai Tanyar, thinks it is unrealistic to expect that there will be no religion classes in Turkey.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The important thing, as he sees it, is the consequence of the RCKE lessons: because of the narrow focus of the content, students are raised with a narrow view of religion and tend to see members of other religions or traditions as "the other".
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:International human rights law does not allow the compulsory teaching of religion with the purpose of instructing students in a particular religion.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:What alternatives in teaching religion to children?
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The Turkish authorities impose significant limitations on teaching religion to children outside the school system.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:As for non-Muslims, legally it is not possible to establish schools for teaching their religion.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:In order to design a course on religion or a course about religions the vital first step is to seek consensus on its purpose and function.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Turkey has the obligation to respect the rights of children to freedom of religion or belief and to respect the rights of parents to educate their children in line with their beliefs.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Society could benefit from a compulsory course about religions with the purpose of promoting an understanding and appreciation of diversity, respect for everyone's human rights as well as providing an objective presentation of religions.
./clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Bermek observes that religion classes should be like any other class.
./clueweb12-0210wb-94-02948:Students are expected to attend the required religion classes held throughout the regular academic year, a Confirmation Retreat, Monthly Youth Rallies, and regular Sunday Masses.
./clueweb12-0210wb-94-02948:Students in Catholic High School (Mater Dei, Saints, OLP, Cathedral) attend religion classes every day and are therefore required to attend the following: Two four-week courses on (1) Stewardship and (2) Justice & Peace, Confirmation Retreat, Monthly Youth Rallies, and regular Sunday Masses.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Even though it costs $5,000 per person per student, to educate a kid in a public school, they figure that if we transfer even a fraction of that money, half of that money, to a parochial school, somehow we are advancing religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:If it costs $5,000 to do a secular education, then $2,500 doesn't even get you the full cost of a secular education, much less advancing religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:I'm also concerned about the outcome of this case as a parent; as a parent who is concerned about my children continuing to be educated in schools in which they are exposed to a diversity of students who are many religions, who are many classes and races, and where tolerance among those groups is taught, where all of us are inculcated to the secular values of citizenship and democracy, and their primary concern of the school is not to indoctrinate children with regard to a particular religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And I'm also concerned about the outcome of this case as a person with a deeply held faith; as a religious person who is concerned that the outcome of this case not diminish either mine or other's freedoms to hold and practice our beliefs without coercion or stigma because of the state's support of one religion or another, even if it be my own.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It has to do with guarding against state coercion, indoctrination, endorsement, stigma, because one religion is favored over another.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It also has to do with the state not supporting one religion in favor of another, the neutrality notion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:You have to remember that Bob says that this is a case about not trusting Catholic or any other kind of religious teachers to know that their job is to teach math or teach physics rather than religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:I think that part of the separation of church and state that protects religion, is that religion, when it does not receive money from the government, is free to teach what it believes and to inculcate in the ways that it wants to inculcate, and that's part of what the separation of church and state is about.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The Establishment Clause also says you're not supposed to establish or show hostility towards religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The parties concede, and the court acknowledges, that this is not a situation where this program was established for the purpose of advancing religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:To exclude the religiously affiliated school, as I said, in my view shows hostility towards religion, which is specifically prohibited by the Establishment Clause.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Third, I reject the notion the public schools are promoting a religion, or an anti-religion of secular humanism.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The Catholic school's not just interested in teaching religion, but they have had a mission to serve more children.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:One is that I think to the extent that I would agree with you that these students were being forced to take a viewpoint that was against their religion, that that is coercive.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:But I think that my concern here is with the Establishment Clause - that if this is being defended as not a primary effect with advancing religion because in fact there's free choice.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It goes into their coffers, to use a phrase that Justice O'Connor often uses, and they can use it any way they want to, including to promote and inculcate religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And indeed, the record of the case shows that most of them say that the promotion and inculcation of religion is integrally entwined with all the education they do.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:However, I would argue that that doesn't make it any better because the effort is to promote their religion to those that aren't believers yet.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Secondly, the crux of the matter, and what I think we'll spend a lot of time talking about today, is the question of whether the voucher plan has the forbidden primary effect of advancing religion, which would be prohibited by our Constitution.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It is ironic in many respects that this case comes up in the way it does, because if there is anything that is clear in the history of church-state relations it's that discrimination in the public school systems on the basis of religion has certainly been rampant since at least in the mid-1840's.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The parties have conceded, and the Sixth Circuit acknowledges, that you don't have a situation where this program was created to advance religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:They didn't make that argument that it was for the purpose of advancing religion.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And I think that to say that this program advances religion because it happens to be that religious schools volunteered, if you will, or agreed to participate in this, and parents are choosing religious schools, the alternative is we penalize the religious schools and we penalize the parents for choosing religious schools, and then we're right back to the lousy schools in Cleveland.
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:"Not even three-pence," Madison said - they had three-pence then - "should be demanded of a taxpayer to support religion."
./clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:So inevitably, the effect of a program that directs money to private schools in that way is to support religion.
./clueweb12-0902wb-21-06658:The League asked all public school boards if and how they will accommodate the wishes of parents and students who object to curriculum demands for reasons of conscience and religion, or who wish their children to receive the information in an alternative format, up to and including removal from class.
./clueweb12-0902wb-21-06658:In response, boards educating a majority of public school students have said they will honour requests for accommodation based on freedom of conscience and religion.
./clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:In some cases this was related to a view that �there�s too much religion in Ireland anyway�, and in others to a fear that in an overtly Christian school those of other religions or none might not be totally comfortable or feel fully valued.
./clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:Existing evidence suggests that children of mixed marriages are frequently brought up in the religion of the mother, and attend the appropriate school, and that this is particularly so when the mother is a Roman Catholic (Compton, 1989).
./clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:Although she taught Religious Education within the school she felt that religion should be the concern of the family and should not determine the choice of school.
./clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:This approach was being closely linked to integration through the concept that only pupils who were confident of their own value could in turn value and respect others, especially others who differed from them in religion, culture or political aspirations.

./clueweb12-1717wb-11-15519:To finish up, it's not really to do with teaching religion in schools but I find it unfair and at odds that people cannot teach in a religious school unless you have been acredited to do so but at the same time, the people of the same background can just waltz right in and preach...I meant teach.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-15519:I think it is plain for any objectors to the FIRIS campaign to see that the overwhelming theme is that the majority of parents, including myself, want eduction for their children about different religions and ethics, not regarding a particular religion as is the current situation.
./clueweb12-1717wb-11-15519:I believe there should be a religious studies programme in State schools teaching about many of the world religions and taught by trained teachers as I do believe it is very important to learn about the religious beliefs and traditions in order to encourage and nurture understanding ,tolerance and delight in the diversity.All the main religions share the basic Golden Rule-do unto others what you would have them do to you or expressed as don't do to another that which you would not like done to you.

./clueweb12-1014wb-27-20704:I find it extremely frustrating that people are still so intolerant when it comes to differences in religion and spirituality (or lack thereof), race, and gender.

./clueweb12-1014wb-27-20704:History of the Law 1968  Epperson v.

./clueweb12-1014wb-27-20704:Often, having a ordained pagan clergy going to speak to CPS on your behalf about paganism as a positive religion is enough to settle a CPS investigation.
./clueweb12-0004wb-69-33089:You know it is so very funny to me that the schools have been trying off and on for years to take God and religion out of the schools all together.
./clueweb12-0004wb-69-33089:I have been a student of Mr. Mullens for five years and not once did i ever hear him say anything about religion.
./clueweb12-0004wb-69-33089:But not the people that keep their nose up everybodys ass when it doesn't suit them and their religion.
./clueweb12-0004wb-69-33089:Also when you seek to replace a possible athiest teacher with a pastor.... It obvious religion was involved.
./clueweb12-0004wb-69-33089:However, because he was possibly an athiest they didn't think that freedom of thought and religion applied.
./clueweb12-0004wb-50-04245:As well, families seem to practice varying degrees of the Jewish religion.
./clueweb12-0004wb-50-04245:Rather than focusing on the practice of religion, the emphasis is on Jewish values and culture.

./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:A significant minority of Christian schools sees their mission as including applicants without regard to religion, as long as parents are aware of the religious nature of the school and will not oppose it.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:Most of the "integration" of religion and basic subject matter at Christian schools would not offend the average American of any faith.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:The influence of the market on financially precarious Christian schools has forced them to moderate the role of religion and to create a more democratic governing structure that is responsive to parents.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:Market forces soften the hard edges of religion as schools compete to attract students and financial support.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:Most Christian schools now see racial inclusion as a way to demonstrate the ability of religion to create ties across races.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:Little is known about African-American Christian schools, but they are likely to differ not only because of race but also because of religion.
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:Interestingly, even the average Christian schooler is not much less likely than other churchgoers to think that a top priority in education is teaching children about diverse races, religions, and cultures (67 percent versus 73 percent).
./clueweb12-0809wb-84-07977:In a similar vein, middle-class and more-educated parents tend to shape Christian schools toward less tension with the outside world, greater emphasis on academic excellence, less rigid social control of students, greater room for individual creativity and expression, and less denominationally distinctive ways of integrating religion into school life.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:Well this is one reason: ACCESS is a political lobby who have lobbied to put religion in the schools by statute and regulation.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:It is clear that ACCESS Ministry wants to be attacked by people who are "against religion".
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:Describing RI volunteer run classes and chaplains in schools as "the Australian experiment" which had been "a miserable failure", Dr. Leslie Cannold has called for a united push to kick religions out of schools.

./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:As Tim Palmer prompts, "They have to pick a religion or nothing".
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:Of all the states, South Australia was most strongly committed to "religious freedom", which of course meant that religion was something for the church and its members to do, not for the government to manage.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:Who teaches religion in Victorian state schools?
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:Other religions have complained of a ''Christian bias'' in Victorian religious education and funding.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:The solution is not to abandon education about religion; events of the past decade illustrate the dangers of religious ignorance and intolerance.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:At a time when most civilizations are divesting themselves from explicit denominational religious instruction in favor of comparative religion, Australia is building up the capacity of "ParaChurches", like ACCESS to keep cartoon religion taught by well meaning volunteers, many of them with impairments of one kind or another, but all selected for their "devotion to faith" rather than their qualifications as teachers.
./clueweb12-1802wb-53-11983:The Honourable Michael Kirby, AC CMG and former Australian High Court judge, will appeal for the traditional place of secularism in Australian public schools, and the protection it offers children who have no religion as well as those who are members of a religion.

./clueweb12-1608wb-16-18876:At one meeting with parents, described in notes as "at times acrimonious", one parent described the teaching of religion in the school as a "planned takeover".
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Some members stated that they didn't practice religion in their homes but would not be bothered it their child learnt about it.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:This begs the question: if the Koran was the religion that was chosen to be presented this year, would they still be interested in having religion taught to their children?
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:If they are practising religion in the home, then their church and home based celebrations should more than suffice in their spiritual needs.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I feel that many members who do not practice religion were inclined to simply agree with the majority, which is a common response in group situations where individuals fear having a different opinion.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:My personal belief is that religion should be optional.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I do not believe that children should remain ignorant to religion, but I would prefer that they understand the basics of a multitude of perspectives, so they could then make an informed decision, should they wish to pursue a religion.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:When I completed the enrolment form, I stated that he did not have a religion, and I was not warned that he may be subjected to religious content in the teaching.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:9th August 05 Hi All, I'd be interested to read any information you have about religion in state schools - I've already seen the article about chaplaincy in schools in SA.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:It seems the majority of people accept these positions without bothering to scrutinise and there also seems to be a feeling that religion is exempt from being questioned in society.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:When religion enters education, rational brain activity ceases.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:And, having been mentally 'unmanned', so to speak as far as religion goes, you're unable to question the idea of an immortal soul - something that has no physical existence whatsoever, yet which contains the total essence of a person so that when he/she dies that 'thing' will go to another place [for which there is no shred of evidence] and "live" - experiencing all the emotions, feelings and sensations of a living human.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Such an action would be seen as ethical in order to promote their religion.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I was wondering on the legality of this because he only represents the christian religion and I feel that this is wrong and he constantly does such annoying stupid fundy things as attack evolution with ridiculous arguments and he is generally very fake and I believe he is here to win over the 'souls' of the kids there.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:My husband wants to ignore the issue with her totally as he is worried our emphasis on religion (even our explanation that we don't believe in it due to a lack of evidence and logical basis) will make it more ingrained in her little head which can't yet comprehend using reason and science rather than myth.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:"While religious beliefs and traditions may be brought into the service in some form as they are part of the lives of members of the community, a service, unless its community has one religion shared by all, will not endorse or embrace a particular set of religious customs and beliefs.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I visited your webpage recently and totally agree with banning religion from secular schools.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Australia needs to change to accommodate the multitude of people learning that religion has no part in our community and joining other schools around the world and banning it from be taught.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I replied to the class teacher that I wish my child to be taught about religion in a comparative context rather than in an exclusive context; which is why she will not be attending, and that I hope the kids that don't attend are given something fun to do rather than being singled out.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:If other parents want their kids to be indoctrinated in religion at school that's their business but I don't see why it should prevent my children from continuing to get an education during this time.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I would like to run classes on Atheism as an alternative and a lot of parents at the school would support this - do you know if there has been any attempt to get Atheism approved as a religion for the purpose of this policy?
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:The website of the Department of education and training fact sheet on Secular Schools reads "The principal of secular education by which the legislation clearly states the government school system is secular and open to the adherents of any philosophy, religion or faith.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Secularism is about keeping the state and religion separate, the way it should be - not privileging religion of any faith.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I believe that religious teachings (scripture) should be completely banned from all State/Public schools across NSW - not to advocate against Christianity, but as a matter of principle - and to allow for the proper separation of state and religion.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:What is your assessment of my proposal that religion in NSW public schools should be completely banned, as this indoctrination fosters a separatist society in NSW?
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:I take this to mean that prayers on parade be ceased, and later, if necessary and the school community approves, replaced by readings done by individuals as opposed to all children being coerced, and providing a number of different religions (not just Christian) are included.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Dear xxxxxx I would like to formally document my concern for the practice of incorporating religion into the curriculum at xxxxxx Preschool, as discussed at the committee meeting on 10 August.
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:We must ask ourselves: "What has religion got to do with pre-school?"
./clueweb12-1705wb-01-27096:Therefore, the Christian religion is not required to ensure that children behave in a manner that is morally and socially acceptable.
./clueweb12-1811wb-82-16602:"The world view presented by those who want religion out of state schools fails to recognise the desires of large numbers of parents who validly desire their children receive religious instruction classes during their time at school," says Jude Hennessy, a representative for Bishop Peter Ingham of Wollongong.
./clueweb12-1811wb-82-16602:Traditionally SRE classes are conducted by volunteers from different religions.
./clueweb12-1811wb-82-16602:These volunteers who teach the doctrine of their religion are generally from Christian denominations such as Catholics.
./clueweb12-1811wb-82-16602:Now there has been a new push by various small interest groups to have such classes axed in favor of a completely secular school system so that any religion is taught as an academic subject and taught across the board as "world religions" rather than focusing on one faith, or on the doctrine of that faith.
./clueweb12-1811wb-82-16602:Among those at the forefront of REENA is Melbourne academic from Monash University, Anna Halafoff and NSW Ph.D scholar at Macquarie University, Cathy Byrne who according to the University website, is studying "what young children are learning about religion in public schools and how SRE influences the construction of their own religious identity and attitudes to religious diversity."
./clueweb12-1802wb-03-27329:Families are perfectly capable of choosing and engaging in religion - the Minister of Education should not negotiate with "faith instructors" in order to introduce sectarian programs in the schools - this is exactly what is happening here, and raising the concerns of organizations in the business of doing "faith instruction" above the interests of teachers and families is a violation of the basic rights of citizens in a society based on the idea of religious toleration and freedom.
./clueweb12-1802wb-03-27329:Would you appreciate it the town just sent over someone from the church to offer to say grace, and asked you to sign a form before you sat down to your meal indicating your interest in the volunteer saying grace at your dinner table (it would only be right at the beginning and said softly) - I mean since when "harm" become a determining factory for the basic right to privacy in matters of religion?
./clueweb12-1802wb-03-27329:"This is a very multi-faith school, and we do not want to divide children on the basis of religion," she said.
./clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:Our letter to the principal stated "a school's choral group can sing songs that are religious in nature" as long as the school does "not appear to endorse religion over nonreligion or one religion over another."
./clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:This reflects established law on religion in the public schools.
./clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:The constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, as interpreted in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, prohibits a public school from giving students the impression that it prefers or sanctions a particular religion, or religion generally.
./clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:A Christmas concert dominated by religious carols, Christian music in the school office, and a creationism video in science class with a theological message are not reflective of religious neutrality, but instead appear to be school endorsement of the Christian religion.
./clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:A sturdy wall separating church and state is essential to preserving and promoting freedom of religion in our increasingly pluralistic nation.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Let us say instead that the separation of children on the basis of the religion of their parents for education is one that beggars belief.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The reason this matters is that more faith schools for different religions are being created.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:More religions than the traditional Church of England and Roman Catholic schools are being set up.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Yet we treat religion very differently.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The issue for me is that religion is for the private sphere not the public sphere.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:We do for religion.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The links below are to a debate about faith and religion in schools as on The Big Debate which Richard Dawkins took part in with others on the panel:
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The world is bigger than the background of faith - and failure to recognise and understand that is one reason where religion is one of those labels by which people ignore our common humanity.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:That wave is the one that Dawkins et al have successfully surfed to draw attention to the issue and problems - because how religion and faith claims are treated are a concern for all of us.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:However non practising children whose mothers were born Jewish are favoured in the code of admission over those whose mothers converted to the religion and regularly practise it.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:If you look carefully at the blog I am attacking the selection of pupils on the basis of religion.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:It provides a public service and as such should not discriminate places on the basis of religion.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Religious Education (RE) in all schools, including faith schools, is aimed at developing pupils' knowledge, understanding and awareness of the major religions represented in the country.
./clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:My concern is public provision that is limited based on religion I find abhorrent - children should not be turned away on the basis of faith.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Yet such changes fail to tackle the fundamental religious freedom problems over the course: the subject remains compulsory, the function of the course - whether it is about religions or the narrow teaching of one faith only (Islam) - is not clarified, exemptions remain limited and require parents to declare their religious or philosophical views, and there is a risk that exempted children suffer bullying from other children and lowered grades from teachers in other subjects.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:To ensure respect for freedom of religion and belief for all in education, Turkey should consider approaching the matter in a holistic manner.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Their compulsory nature, their content lacking objectivity and pluralism, and finally the lack of an adequate framework for exemptions continue to pose problems to the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief in the educational setting in Turkey.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Many in Turkey argue that further reform of primary and secondary school education to facilitate freedom of religion or belief is necessary.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Because the military leadership of 1980 saw the value of a certain form of "restrained religion" as a unifying factor for the nation and as a preventative tool against what it considered marginal movements, a provision was inserted into Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution making RCKE classes compulsory in primary and secondary education.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The same provision goes on to say that "education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be conducted under state supervision and control", explicitly demonstrating the state's strong interest in imposing its control.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Jehovah's Witnesses can be exempted from RCKE classes, either by presenting their ID cards stating that they are Christians (since the state regards Jehovah's Witnesses as a denomination within Christianity, not as a separate religion) or - if the religion section in their ID card is blank - by providing a letter from the Council of Representatives of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:On the one hand, the government claims that the RCKE course synopsis includes teaching about all religions, while on the other there is a limited opt-out possibility.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:If the teaching includes all religions, why does the system allow exemption?
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:"Conversely, if the course is essentially designed to teach the Muslim religion, it is a course on a specific religion and should not be compulsory, in order to preserve children's and their parents' religious freedom."
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The changes made in the textbooks for the 2011/2012 school year to include Alevi and Caferi teachings do not remove the paradox, because the RCKE course still teaches only one religion (Islam) and no adequate exemption is in place.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:On the other hand it is important to note that these improvements alone do not make the RCKE classes a lesson "about religions".
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Also, while this step may satisfy some Alevi groups there are certainly other Alevis who remain categorically against the teaching of religion by the State.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Such changes do not include an appropriate opt-out structure for anyone who finds these lessons to be in conflict with their religious beliefs or philosophical views, nor moving to a course that is "about religions".
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:By contrast, the Emek, Demokrasi ve Özgürlük Blok (Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc), the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) oppose compulsory religion classes.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Bloc instead proposed history of religions and religious studies as optional lessons.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:In June 2011 the Education Reform Initiative (ERG) of Sabanci University in Istanbul expressed concern about the lack of proposals on the continuation of a democratic, plural and participatory discussion on education about religions instead of religious education.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:He argues that elements that teach a certain religion with the purpose of influencing the child to adopt the religion and its practices must be eliminated, and the lessons should be strictly "about religions".
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Bermek also notes that calls to reject entirely any religion classes polarise society and cause the discussions to revolve around whether or not to have religion lessons, rather than on the content.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Bermek observes that religion classes should be like any other class.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Since no other subject is mentioned in the Constitution, religion lessons should also not be mentioned in the Constitution.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Chair of the Association of Protestant Churches, Zekai Tanyar, thinks it is unrealistic to expect that there will be no religion classes in Turkey.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The important thing, as he sees it, is the consequence of the RCKE lessons: because of the narrow focus of the content, students are raised with a narrow view of religion and tend to see members of other religions or traditions as "the other".
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:What alternatives in teaching religion to children?
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Turkish authorities impose significant limitations on teaching religion to children outside the school system.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:As for non-Muslims, legally it is not possible to establish schools for teaching their religion.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:In order to design a course on religion or a course about religions the vital first step is to seek consensus on its purpose and function.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:It seems to strive to be both a course on teaching Islam and a course on religions and it is not working.
./clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Turkey has the obligation to respect the rights of children to freedom of religion or belief and to respect the rights of parents to educate their children in line with their beliefs.
./clueweb12-1913wb-81-03176:These include volunteer catechists from the Sydney Archdiocese as well as those trained by other faiths to give religious instruction in Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism or any other of the world's major religions.

../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The meeting of world religions, the need for dialogue between them, has still no significant place in many theological schools and seminaries.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Since the groups which have sought to establish these schools are of a clearly religious character it is often argued that their efforts represent nothing more than an attempt to extend the existing dual system of educational provision in this country to embrace other faiths which are now part of British society, and the resistance and antagonism which such attempts have aroused have been seen as manifestations of institutional racism in that the 'system' is failing to accord equal treatment to the religions of ethnic minority groups.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Where there was some parental resistance (usually from the majority community) to studying religions other than Christianity, it was felt that this could best be overcome through 'parent education' - explaining to parents what the school was endeavouring to achieve through its religious education programme.

../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Several of the religious education teachers felt that they often had a particular insight into the needs and concerns of ethnic minority pupils and their families because of their understanding of the influence of religion on their lives, and were therefore able to act as catalysts within the school to encourage curriculum development on a broader front.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.18 Several teachers expressed concern to us about the difficulties of obtaining textbooks and teaching materials which reflected a multi-faith view of religious education and which did not present religions other than Christianity in negative or inaccurate terms.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Whilst it was acknowledged that out of date textbooks which misrepresented other religions might cause offence to adherents of these faiths, the view was also expressed that such textbooks might themselves provide a valuable subject for discussion with pupils since they raised issues relating to stereotyping, religious prejudice and how non-believers could perceive other faiths.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The syllabus should thus be used to enlarge and deepen the pupils' understanding of religion by studying world religions, and by exploring all those elements in human experience which raise questions about life's ultimate meaning and value.

../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:3.5 Since the 1944 Education Act saw an act of collective worship as an integral part of a school's provision for religious education, we begin by considering the specific issues which have arisen in relation to this aspect of schools' work, before looking at the place of religion within the school curriculum.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Other multi-racial schools have sought to give some recognition to religions other than Christianity through including references to religious festivals from other faiths in assemblies, while a number of schools have continued with a traditional Christian-oriented act of worship.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Religious festivals from major religions are looked at as are parables from world religions.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is important to recognise that the faiths of these minority communities are in no sense 'minority' religions, but are major faiths which have often played a leading role in shaping world history.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'Religions and culture are closely interwoven and often religion is the very "soul" of culture.'
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Any consideration of religious education must recognise that there has long been an emotive and often passionate debate about the role of schools in relation to religion in a society which can be seen as increasingly secular in terms of the level of active religious observance amongst the majority of its members: a debate to which the multi-faith character of schools with substantial ethnic minority populations has now added a further dimension.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'... in religious education, the school is operating on the boundary between itself and the local community in that it is dealing with the religious traditions, beliefs and values of the society in which it is set ... Religious education shares with other subjects the task of helping children to acquire the skills, knowledge and social competence necessary for their personal development and life in society ... However, religious education also makes a distinctive contribution to the curriculum in directing attention to the religious understanding of human life and to the central values (many of them derived from religion) which society seeks to uphold and to transmit.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:In this consideration of religion and values, the intention is to help pupils to understand the nature of religious questions and religious affirmations, and to develop a personal and intellectual integrity in dealing with the profoundest aspects of their own experience now and in adult life.'
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.2 It must also be recognised however that religious education is seen by many as a particularly difficult aspect of the educational experience to define since the phrase itself seems to be almost a contradiction in terms - the task of education being to teach children to exercise flexibility of mind and to seek rational explanations for situations, whilst the essence of religion is seen by many as belief, and in many faiths, an acceptance of revelation.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.3 Before considering the various interpretations which have been placed on religious education, it must be acknowledged that the very principle of religion having a place within the school curriculum has been challenged on the grounds that schools exist primarily to equip their pupils with a range of practical skills and factual information and it is beyond their role and responsibility to seek to educate pupils in an area of experience which is uniquely personal and in which there is no single accepted corpus of knowledge.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:They therefore reject the concept of religious education seeing it as a form of indoctrination which seeks to 'impose' religion on young people.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'We accept the right of those who do not subscribe to any religion to refuse to be a party to religious education for their children ... But they have no right to deny religious education to those who want it.

../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.8 The phenomenological or non-denominational and undogmatic view draws a clear distinction between what can strictly speaking be termed 'religious instruction' i.e. instruction in a religion, and 'religious education' i.e. education in the concept of religion and in the range of belief systems which exist.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is seen as the function of the home and of the religious community to nurture and instruct a child in a particular faith (or not), and the function of the school to assist pupils to understand the nature of religion and to know something of the diversity of belief systems, their significance for individuals and how these bear on the community.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The essential distinction between the confessional and the phenomenological approach to Christianity within religious education is, however, that whereas the former approach would tend to present Christianity as the only 'true' religion and, if any reference was made to other religions, would present these solely in Christian terms, the latter would more accurately reflect the multiplicity of beliefs and non-beliefs including Christianity - now present in society.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The National Secular Society, for example, suggests that the study of religion on these terms should be included as part of the history syllabus ...
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The confessional approach to religious education can be seen as the traditional view of the role of the school in relation to religion which was without doubt the approach which the framers of the 1944 Education Act had in mind in requiring schools to provide 'religious instruction' (see paragraph 3.2 below) - their terminology indeed indicates clearly that they saw the task for religious education as inculcating young people into a specific religious faith: Christianity.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'The tradition of our national life has been largely shaped and sustained by behaviour and ideas closely associated with the practice of religion, and particularly the Christian religion.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It is regrettable that this view of religious education has led to concern in some quarters that Christianity risks being submerged within a 'Cook's tour' of the world's religions.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:'... while recognising that a truly pluralist society - if such we are - should not merely tolerate diversity but value and nurture it, I must also express the fear that at times we seem tempted to sacrifice too much of our native Christian tradition on the altar of multiculturalism ... when I read, in one approved syllabus, of the need in religious education "to set Christianity alongside other religions", as if it were part of some creedal smorgasbord, or that "it should be part of an education for life in this country that children come to know something of the traditional religion of the land, namely Christianity" (as if Christianity was, like Shakespeare, parliamentary democracy or roast beef, part of a living heritage rather than a living faith), I wonder whether we are not, as Christian educators, selling Christianity short by carrying our anti-confessionalism too far.'
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The intention of the phenomenological approach to religious education is however in no way to 'reduce' Christianity to simply one element in an arid survey of world religions, but rather to set the consideration of Christianity, in all its spiritual depth and fullness, within a wider context of the true significance of the religious dimension to life, in all its forms.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:2.10 Much of the evidence which we have received from ethnic minority communities has related to the provision of religious education in schools and particularly to the place accorded to religions other than Christianity.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:It was pointed out to us that religions such as Islam and Sikhism are major world faiths in a global context and are in no way therefore 'minority' religions, inferior to Christianity, simply because they might have fewer adherents in this country.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:The view of religious education mentioned above held by some sections of certain ethnic minority religious communities can be seen, if taken to its logical conclusion of children from a particular faith community being 'instructed' only in their own religion, as also in the confessional spirit but, in terms of the nature of the educational provision made - i.e. with different groups of children receiving different forms of religious education - as separatist in effect.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Total absorption of minority groups into 'mainstream' eradication of culture and religion; notion of normativeness.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:ethnic minority origin, it was pointed out that if this approach were adopted in schools seeking to cover a range of world faiths this would necessitate perhaps four or five teachers 'representing' the different religions, which would clearly not be feasible.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Since the philosophy of the phenomenological approach to religious education was however not to teach children a religion but rather to teach children to understand the nature of belief and a range of belief systems, it was felt that this attitude was unjustified.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Not surprisingly there was a serious shortage of such teachers since until the implementation of the Act, religion could not be offered as a qualifying subject for the teacher's certificate.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Obviously the parents would not particularly want to send their children to a school of another religion ... Once the school becomes an all white school there will be a strong demand to create a Sikh school.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:With regard to the treatment of religion, the emphasis in many of the submissions which we have received is, as we have already recalled in the first part of this chapter, on the need to instruct and confirm the pupils in their Islamic faith through a 'confessional' style approach and although it has been suggested that Muslim schools might admit some non-Muslim pupils the intention would still be to offer different religious groups instruction in their own religions.
../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Many of these differences of emphasis arise from the apparent irreconcilability of the requirements of a religion, which of its very nature influences every aspect of an individual's life, and the pressures of our secular society.

../docs/clueweb12-1911wb-39-06996:Tolerance Pupils should be developing a willingness to maintain and protect the legal right of religious believers to practice their religion, and also the rights of people not to practise a religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0006wb-53-08077:The mother, however, shares her husband's disinclination to open up serious subjects with the little ones, her own mind being so little set that way; she has her dinner parties to arrange, her dances and balls to organise or attend, her guests to invite or to visit; and so religion goes to the wall, and unless by good fortune there be some old faithful retainer who will instruct her young charges out of her own simple faith, deep must be the ignorance and pitiful the condition of the children of such parents.
../docs/clueweb12-0006wb-53-08077:For middle-class, no less than for upper-class children, nothing can take the place of loving, faithful, earnest teaching at the mother's knee; and to bring this about there must be true religion in the mother's heart.

../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Yet such changes fail to tackle the fundamental religious freedom problems over the course: the subject remains compulsory, the function of the course - whether it is about religions or the narrow teaching of one faith only (Islam) - is not clarified, exemptions remain limited and require parents to declare their religious or philosophical views, and there is a risk that exempted children suffer bullying from other children and lowered grades from teachers in other subjects.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:To ensure respect for freedom of religion and belief for all in education, Turkey should consider approaching the matter in a holistic manner.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Their compulsory nature, their content lacking objectivity and pluralism, and finally the lack of an adequate framework for exemptions continue to pose problems to the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief in the educational setting in Turkey.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Many in Turkey argue that further reform of primary and secondary school education to facilitate freedom of religion or belief is necessary.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Because the military leadership of 1980 saw the value of a certain form of "restrained religion" as a unifying factor for the nation and as a preventative tool against what it considered marginal movements, a provision was inserted into Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution making RCKE classes compulsory in primary and secondary education.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The same provision goes on to say that "education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be conducted under state supervision and control", explicitly demonstrating the state's strong interest in imposing its control.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Jehovah's Witnesses can be exempted from RCKE classes, either by presenting their ID cards stating that they are Christians (since the state regards Jehovah's Witnesses as a denomination within Christianity, not as a separate religion) or - if the religion section in their ID card is blank - by providing a letter from the Council of Representatives of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:On the one hand, the government claims that the RCKE course synopsis includes teaching about all religions, while on the other there is a limited opt-out possibility.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:If the teaching includes all religions, why does the system allow exemption?
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:"Conversely, if the course is essentially designed to teach the Muslim religion, it is a course on a specific religion and should not be compulsory, in order to preserve children's and their parents' religious freedom."
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The changes made in the textbooks for the 2011/2012 school year to include Alevi and Caferi teachings do not remove the paradox, because the RCKE course still teaches only one religion (Islam) and no adequate exemption is in place.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:On the other hand it is important to note that these improvements alone do not make the RCKE classes a lesson "about religions".
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Also, while this step may satisfy some Alevi groups there are certainly other Alevis who remain categorically against the teaching of religion by the State.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Such changes do not include an appropriate opt-out structure for anyone who finds these lessons to be in conflict with their religious beliefs or philosophical views, nor moving to a course that is "about religions".
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:By contrast, the Emek, Demokrasi ve Özgürlük Blok (Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc), the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) oppose compulsory religion classes.

../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:In June 2011 the Education Reform Initiative (ERG) of Sabanci University in Istanbul expressed concern about the lack of proposals on the continuation of a democratic, plural and participatory discussion on education about religions instead of religious education.

../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Bermek also notes that calls to reject entirely any religion classes polarise society and cause the discussions to revolve around whether or not to have religion lessons, rather than on the content.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The Chair of the Association of Protestant Churches, Zekai Tanyar, thinks it is unrealistic to expect that there will be no religion classes in Turkey.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:The important thing, as he sees it, is the consequence of the RCKE lessons: because of the narrow focus of the content, students are raised with a narrow view of religion and tend to see members of other religions or traditions as "the other".

../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:As for non-Muslims, legally it is not possible to establish schools for teaching their religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:In order to design a course on religion or a course about religions the vital first step is to seek consensus on its purpose and function.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Turkey has the obligation to respect the rights of children to freedom of religion or belief and to respect the rights of parents to educate their children in line with their beliefs.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Society could benefit from a compulsory course about religions with the purpose of promoting an understanding and appreciation of diversity, respect for everyone's human rights as well as providing an objective presentation of religions.
../docs/clueweb12-0309wb-77-15819:Bermek observes that religion classes should be like any other class.
../docs/clueweb12-0210wb-94-02948:Students are expected to attend the required religion classes held throughout the regular academic year, a Confirmation Retreat, Monthly Youth Rallies, and regular Sunday Masses.
../docs/clueweb12-0210wb-94-02948:Students in Catholic High School (Mater Dei, Saints, OLP, Cathedral) attend religion classes every day and are therefore required to attend the following: Two four-week courses on (1) Stewardship and (2) Justice & Peace, Confirmation Retreat, Monthly Youth Rallies, and regular Sunday Masses.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Even though it costs $5,000 per person per student, to educate a kid in a public school, they figure that if we transfer even a fraction of that money, half of that money, to a parochial school, somehow we are advancing religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:If it costs $5,000 to do a secular education, then $2,500 doesn't even get you the full cost of a secular education, much less advancing religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:I'm also concerned about the outcome of this case as a parent; as a parent who is concerned about my children continuing to be educated in schools in which they are exposed to a diversity of students who are many religions, who are many classes and races, and where tolerance among those groups is taught, where all of us are inculcated to the secular values of citizenship and democracy, and their primary concern of the school is not to indoctrinate children with regard to a particular religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And I'm also concerned about the outcome of this case as a person with a deeply held faith; as a religious person who is concerned that the outcome of this case not diminish either mine or other's freedoms to hold and practice our beliefs without coercion or stigma because of the state's support of one religion or another, even if it be my own.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It has to do with guarding against state coercion, indoctrination, endorsement, stigma, because one religion is favored over another.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It also has to do with the state not supporting one religion in favor of another, the neutrality notion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:You have to remember that Bob says that this is a case about not trusting Catholic or any other kind of religious teachers to know that their job is to teach math or teach physics rather than religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:I think that part of the separation of church and state that protects religion, is that religion, when it does not receive money from the government, is free to teach what it believes and to inculcate in the ways that it wants to inculcate, and that's part of what the separation of church and state is about.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The Establishment Clause also says you're not supposed to establish or show hostility towards religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The parties concede, and the court acknowledges, that this is not a situation where this program was established for the purpose of advancing religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:To exclude the religiously affiliated school, as I said, in my view shows hostility towards religion, which is specifically prohibited by the Establishment Clause.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Third, I reject the notion the public schools are promoting a religion, or an anti-religion of secular humanism.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The Catholic school's not just interested in teaching religion, but they have had a mission to serve more children.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:One is that I think to the extent that I would agree with you that these students were being forced to take a viewpoint that was against their religion, that that is coercive.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:But I think that my concern here is with the Establishment Clause - that if this is being defended as not a primary effect with advancing religion because in fact there's free choice.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It goes into their coffers, to use a phrase that Justice O'Connor often uses, and they can use it any way they want to, including to promote and inculcate religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And indeed, the record of the case shows that most of them say that the promotion and inculcation of religion is integrally entwined with all the education they do.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:However, I would argue that that doesn't make it any better because the effort is to promote their religion to those that aren't believers yet.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:Secondly, the crux of the matter, and what I think we'll spend a lot of time talking about today, is the question of whether the voucher plan has the forbidden primary effect of advancing religion, which would be prohibited by our Constitution.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:It is ironic in many respects that this case comes up in the way it does, because if there is anything that is clear in the history of church-state relations it's that discrimination in the public school systems on the basis of religion has certainly been rampant since at least in the mid-1840's.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:The parties have conceded, and the Sixth Circuit acknowledges, that you don't have a situation where this program was created to advance religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:They didn't make that argument that it was for the purpose of advancing religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:And I think that to say that this program advances religion because it happens to be that religious schools volunteered, if you will, or agreed to participate in this, and parents are choosing religious schools, the alternative is we penalize the religious schools and we penalize the parents for choosing religious schools, and then we're right back to the lousy schools in Cleveland.
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:"Not even three-pence," Madison said - they had three-pence then - "should be demanded of a taxpayer to support religion."
../docs/clueweb12-0209wb-75-25910:So inevitably, the effect of a program that directs money to private schools in that way is to support religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0902wb-21-06658:The League asked all public school boards if and how they will accommodate the wishes of parents and students who object to curriculum demands for reasons of conscience and religion, or who wish their children to receive the information in an alternative format, up to and including removal from class.
../docs/clueweb12-0902wb-21-06658:In response, boards educating a majority of public school students have said they will honour requests for accommodation based on freedom of conscience and religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:In some cases this was related to a view that �there�s too much religion in Ireland anyway�, and in others to a fear that in an overtly Christian school those of other religions or none might not be totally comfortable or feel fully valued.
../docs/clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:Existing evidence suggests that children of mixed marriages are frequently brought up in the religion of the mother, and attend the appropriate school, and that this is particularly so when the mother is a Roman Catholic (Compton, 1989).
../docs/clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:Although she taught Religious Education within the school she felt that religion should be the concern of the family and should not determine the choice of school.
../docs/clueweb12-0306wb-61-26920:This approach was being closely linked to integration through the concept that only pupils who were confident of their own value could in turn value and respect others, especially others who differed from them in religion, culture or political aspirations.

../docs/clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:The constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, as interpreted in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, prohibits a public school from giving students the impression that it prefers or sanctions a particular religion, or religion generally.
../docs/clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:A Christmas concert dominated by religious carols, Christian music in the school office, and a creationism video in science class with a theological message are not reflective of religious neutrality, but instead appear to be school endorsement of the Christian religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0918wb-43-25070:A sturdy wall separating church and state is essential to preserving and promoting freedom of religion in our increasingly pluralistic nation.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Let us say instead that the separation of children on the basis of the religion of their parents for education is one that beggars belief.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The reason this matters is that more faith schools for different religions are being created.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:More religions than the traditional Church of England and Roman Catholic schools are being set up.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Yet we treat religion very differently.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The issue for me is that religion is for the private sphere not the public sphere.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:We do for religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The links below are to a debate about faith and religion in schools as on The Big Debate which Richard Dawkins took part in with others on the panel:
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:The world is bigger than the background of faith - and failure to recognise and understand that is one reason where religion is one of those labels by which people ignore our common humanity.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:That wave is the one that Dawkins et al have successfully surfed to draw attention to the issue and problems - because how religion and faith claims are treated are a concern for all of us.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:However non practising children whose mothers were born Jewish are favoured in the code of admission over those whose mothers converted to the religion and regularly practise it.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:If you look carefully at the blog I am attacking the selection of pupils on the basis of religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:It provides a public service and as such should not discriminate places on the basis of religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:Religious Education (RE) in all schools, including faith schools, is aimed at developing pupils' knowledge, understanding and awareness of the major religions represented in the country.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-53-06671:My concern is public provision that is limited based on religion I find abhorrent - children should not be turned away on the basis of faith.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Yet such changes fail to tackle the fundamental religious freedom problems over the course: the subject remains compulsory, the function of the course - whether it is about religions or the narrow teaching of one faith only (Islam) - is not clarified, exemptions remain limited and require parents to declare their religious or philosophical views, and there is a risk that exempted children suffer bullying from other children and lowered grades from teachers in other subjects.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:To ensure respect for freedom of religion and belief for all in education, Turkey should consider approaching the matter in a holistic manner.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Their compulsory nature, their content lacking objectivity and pluralism, and finally the lack of an adequate framework for exemptions continue to pose problems to the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief in the educational setting in Turkey.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Many in Turkey argue that further reform of primary and secondary school education to facilitate freedom of religion or belief is necessary.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Because the military leadership of 1980 saw the value of a certain form of "restrained religion" as a unifying factor for the nation and as a preventative tool against what it considered marginal movements, a provision was inserted into Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution making RCKE classes compulsory in primary and secondary education.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The same provision goes on to say that "education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be conducted under state supervision and control", explicitly demonstrating the state's strong interest in imposing its control.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Jehovah's Witnesses can be exempted from RCKE classes, either by presenting their ID cards stating that they are Christians (since the state regards Jehovah's Witnesses as a denomination within Christianity, not as a separate religion) or - if the religion section in their ID card is blank - by providing a letter from the Council of Representatives of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:On the one hand, the government claims that the RCKE course synopsis includes teaching about all religions, while on the other there is a limited opt-out possibility.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:If the teaching includes all religions, why does the system allow exemption?
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:"Conversely, if the course is essentially designed to teach the Muslim religion, it is a course on a specific religion and should not be compulsory, in order to preserve children's and their parents' religious freedom."
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The changes made in the textbooks for the 2011/2012 school year to include Alevi and Caferi teachings do not remove the paradox, because the RCKE course still teaches only one religion (Islam) and no adequate exemption is in place.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:On the other hand it is important to note that these improvements alone do not make the RCKE classes a lesson "about religions".
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Also, while this step may satisfy some Alevi groups there are certainly other Alevis who remain categorically against the teaching of religion by the State.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Such changes do not include an appropriate opt-out structure for anyone who finds these lessons to be in conflict with their religious beliefs or philosophical views, nor moving to a course that is "about religions".
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:By contrast, the Emek, Demokrasi ve Özgürlük Blok (Labour, Democracy and Freedom Bloc), the Turkish Communist Party (TKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) oppose compulsory religion classes.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Bloc instead proposed history of religions and religious studies as optional lessons.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:In June 2011 the Education Reform Initiative (ERG) of Sabanci University in Istanbul expressed concern about the lack of proposals on the continuation of a democratic, plural and participatory discussion on education about religions instead of religious education.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:He argues that elements that teach a certain religion with the purpose of influencing the child to adopt the religion and its practices must be eliminated, and the lessons should be strictly "about religions".
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Bermek also notes that calls to reject entirely any religion classes polarise society and cause the discussions to revolve around whether or not to have religion lessons, rather than on the content.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Bermek observes that religion classes should be like any other class.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Since no other subject is mentioned in the Constitution, religion lessons should also not be mentioned in the Constitution.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Chair of the Association of Protestant Churches, Zekai Tanyar, thinks it is unrealistic to expect that there will be no religion classes in Turkey.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The important thing, as he sees it, is the consequence of the RCKE lessons: because of the narrow focus of the content, students are raised with a narrow view of religion and tend to see members of other religions or traditions as "the other".
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:What alternatives in teaching religion to children?
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:The Turkish authorities impose significant limitations on teaching religion to children outside the school system.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:As for non-Muslims, legally it is not possible to establish schools for teaching their religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:In order to design a course on religion or a course about religions the vital first step is to seek consensus on its purpose and function.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:It seems to strive to be both a course on teaching Islam and a course on religions and it is not working.
../docs/clueweb12-0813wb-86-13229:Turkey has the obligation to respect the rights of children to freedom of religion or belief and to respect the rights of parents to educate their children in line with their beliefs.
../docs/clueweb12-1913wb-81-03176:These include volunteer catechists from the Sydney Archdiocese as well as those trained by other faiths to give religious instruction in Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism or any other of the world's major religions.
../docs/clueweb12-1913wb-81-03176:General Religious Education, by contrast, is broader in scope and involves the general study of the world's religions, allowing students to explore these different beliefs and the affect they have on the lives of their adherents.
../docs/clueweb12-1705wb-31-15679:The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.
../docs/clueweb12-1705wb-31-15679:The question therefore has to be asked: Why have state governments taken it on themselves to override the intent behind the Constitution to promote Christian religion, and in the case of Chaplaincy, a divisive, backward thinking Fundamentalism, in State Schools.
../docs/clueweb12-1705wb-31-15679:The 'opt out' policy and the over represented specific 'faith' input demonstrate a will by government to place children in its care in a position of potential indoctrination by one section of the Christian religion.
../docs/clueweb12-1705wb-31-15679:It is obvious to students, that their schools promote one particular religion over others and no religion.
../docs/clueweb12-0913wb-72-24793:The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:I am o f the impression that VECs try to make pupils aware and respectful of the diversity of religion and none in a similar way to Educate Together schools.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:There is a middle ground in this debate and there are many people somewhere in the middle on this issue rather than at your end of the spectrum (no religion in schools at all) and those that believe in denominational models as the best model.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:It's a pity that throughout your comments that we are still none the wiser about what goes on during the half hour everyday when religion is taught (almost 11% of teaching time).
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:This conversation is simply trying to find out information about what happens during religion time in these schools.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Right now I have a problem with the VEC model because if children are segregated during religion time and Catholic religion is taught by default, this is not moving away from a church-run system, which the majority of Irish people want.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:In the new schools, the children are taught together at religion time (about 30 minutes every day) for at least 80% of the time during the school year.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:In denominational schools, all children are indoctrinated in the teachings of the particular religion throughout the day though children can be withdrawn from discrete religion classes.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Only those faiths considered to be the 'main religions in the school community' will be provided with State-funded faith-formation teachers, and those that do not qualify will be taught a common ethics programme."
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:If you are lucky enough to be part of the Catholic community in your class, you get to stay there during religion time.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:In effect it is what happens currently in the majority of denominational schools, except this time the school can offer supervision to those choosing not to do religion classes.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:As the national school system is based on a single teacher delivering the whole programme, what obligations will be placed on that teacher about the teaching of religion?
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:During this 3-4 week period of school, who teaches the non-Christian religions?
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Instead they teach what I would call an ethical programme during the 'religion' half-hour each day.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:My impression is that this is basically a form of ethics and teaching about religions.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:If the parents want religion taught in school for their children, it has to take place outside of the school day.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Some schools will make space available but parents sometimes have to pay then for religion to be taught to their children.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:At the end of a religion class 2 or 3 times a week, those who believe in a single god (at present mainly christians and muslims) are invited to think a prayer to their god (but not to Jesus).
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:For 3 - 4 weeks during the year, the children spend all religion classes tohether in their faith groups (in the current schools because of the children attending, those groups are catholic, christian, muslim and others).
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:While the children are receiving some specific religious education, there is still much more required of parents and their (faith) community with this model (think of how prayer and religion was knitted into every part of your school day growing up!
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Anecdotal evidence so far is that the children and their parents are happy with the religion classes (but of course they'd need to be included in any assessment of the pilot programme).
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:Surely this is a better preparation for the new Ireland than ignoring religion and difference in the reality of everyday school life?
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:It is also important that these new community national schools don't develop into some kind of 'anti-religion' society because for most people (me at least), religion is still important at some point in their lives.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:With the new Community National Schools they can have religion or not but there is no extreme position involved.
../docs/clueweb12-1803wb-36-04059:The ethics programme is a lot more than just teaching about religions.
