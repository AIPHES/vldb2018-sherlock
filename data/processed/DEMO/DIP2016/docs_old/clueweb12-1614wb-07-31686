In addition to Open House and Back-to-School Night, all DoDEA schools encourage parents to meet with their child's teacher for parent-teacher conferences.
Write down a list of questions, issues or concerns that you have for the teacher.
Your child's home life, personality, concerns, habits and hobbies, and other things you feel the teacher should know about that might help in working with your child (e.g. transitioning to a new school, parent deployed, part-time jobs, a sick relative, religious holidays, music lessons, etc.).
This will help you put a better perspective on what the teacher says about your child.
Teachers might ask you for an example of a good experience or problem area your child has had in school.
If I sense my child is struggling, what should I do?
What do the tests show about my child's progress?
Be sure your child knows that both you and the teacher care about how he/she is doing in school.
