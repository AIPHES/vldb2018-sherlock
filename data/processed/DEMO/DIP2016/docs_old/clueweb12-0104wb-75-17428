Since time is precious and there is so much to teach, it is imperative that students attend Religious School regularly.
It is therefore the child's responsibility to make up any missed class work.
Please alert the school at 858-535-1111 (ext.3121) if your child is ill, on vacation, or otherwise unable to attend class.
The school will contact parents after two consecutive absences.
LOST AND FOUND : Check the Religious School office for items lost at school.
SCHOOL VISITORS : Adults should feel free to visit the Religious School classrooms and programs with permission from the Director of Religious School Education.
Children who are not enrolled in our Religious School may attend only in pressing circumstances with the advance consent of an administrative staff member, and with a parent's written permission .
SPECIAL NEEDS : If your child has any special needs, including dietary restrictions, learning difficulties, or emotional or psychological concerns, it is important that you tell our Faculty Coordinator/Special Needs Consultant Debbie Rabin, so that the teacher may be informed and your child will get the proper care and attention.
EARLY PICKUP : Our first priority is the safety of the children.
