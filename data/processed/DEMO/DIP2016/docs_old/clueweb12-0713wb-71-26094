At most public and some private schools, children who are 5 years old (by September 30) attend kindergarten.
The Columbus Public Schools has alternative schools which differ from conventional schools in the way subjects are taught or in the focus of the instruction (arts, sciences, or foreign languages, for example.)
Acceptable documents for the child's birth date are: a valid passport, form I-94, or birth certificate in English.
Note: If you do not have a record of your child's immunizations, take your child to be immunized at the public health department.
In the Columbus area there are a number of schools affiliated with religious organizations.
These schools are partially subsidized by the religious organization as well as the family.
Children learn the same basic subjects as in conventional public schools but may also study religion.
Hot lunches are provided at the school and parents may be asked to volunteer to help with various school services.
In order to enroll and/or learn more about the parochial schools in your area, check with appropriate religious organizations under "Schools" in the yellow pages of the telephone directory.
The philosophies of the schools vary greatly so parents should visit the school and read about its philosophy before enrolling their children.
Acceptable reasons for absence are: sickness, sickness or death in the family, and religious holidays.
Schedule appointments with doctors or dentists after school hours when possible so the child will not miss school.
Play times are usually outside so your child may need an extra jacket or sweater.
If you would enjoy helping with school activities or want to share information about your culture, let your child's principal or teacher know at the beginning of the year.
